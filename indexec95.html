		<p class="message">Will any political party will stand up for the rights of refugees and people seeking asylum? Do the votes of refugees, anti-racists and supporters of human rights and migrants rights count? Do the candidates support the creation of a ‚Äúhostile environment‚Äù for some people coming to live, seek safety or work in this country? How will the candidates challenge racism and xenophobia towards refugees and migrants?<br /><br />South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG) has organised this Asylum Rights Election Question Time, where you get the chance to question representatives from most of the parties standing in the general election in South Yorkshire. The event is also supported by all of the major asylum/migration organisations and charities in our region: the Committee to Defend Asylum Seekers; Sheffield City of Sanctuary; South Yorkshire Refugee Law and Justice; ASSIST and Northern Refugee Centre<br /><br />The meeting starts at 7pm but doors open at 6.30pm for a cup of tea and a chance to look around the information stalls. After short introductions to the main issues facing refugees and people seeking asylum from the vice-chairs of SYMAAG, the politicians will make short speeches, leaving plenty of time for your points and questions. If you want to ask a question but can‚Äôt get to the meeting use the Twitter hashtag #asylumrights and they will try to put your point to the politicians.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.symaag.org.uk/">www.symaag.org.uk</a> Twitter: @SYMAAG Tel: Sheff 2729332 extension 332</p>
