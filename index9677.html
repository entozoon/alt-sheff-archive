		<p class="message">Extinction Rebellion (XR) groups across the world are gathering in unity in key cities to rebel, because time is running out. Climate and ecological breakdown has already begun. Leading scientists and public figures, including the UN Secretary-General, have estimated we have as little as 18 months to turn it around. <br /><br />We ALL need to stand up for the Mother Earth and respect ALL life. Authority and corporations will not listen to petitions, strongly-worded pleas, or climate scientists. They have failed in their duty to protect Mother Earth. The system is broken. Young and old, we must stand together in peace. <br /><br /><strong>See also Extinction Rebellion current updates on our <a href="https://alt-sheff.org/stories">News page</a>. <br /><br />In Sheffield,  Introductory Sessions are now being run on both Saturdays (11am) and Mondays (6.45pm) during the rebellion at Union Street co-working space. Their main meetings continue on Mondays along with the introductions. They are also hoping to run a stall in Sheffield City centre and information drop-in sessions at Union Street on Saturdays, so if you could help with one of these, please email <a href="mailto:xrsheffield@gmail.com">xrsheffield@gmail.com</a>.</strong><br /><br /><a href="https://www.xrsheffield.org/">XR Sheffield</a><br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/350862888939201/">Facebook event page</a> <br /><a href="https://urlzs.com/RppA8">XR information page for event</a><br /><a href="https://www.fridaysforfuture.org/">Fridays For Future</a><br /><a href="https://climatevegan.org/why-become-a-climate-vegan/">Climatevegan.org</a></p>

		<p class="message">An evening of great music as a living testimony to the fact that cultures can and do mix. It unites us and gives us strength, and offers a vibrant celebration of our multicultural and multiracial society. Racism seeks only to divide and weaken us. Love Music Hate Racism (LMHR) was set up in 2002 in response to rising levels of racism, in the tradition of the Rock Against Racism (RAR) movement of the late 1970s. There have been now been many hundreds of LMHR events, from large outdoor festivals to local gigs and club nights. It is time to reignite our national movement against racism through music. <br /><br />BASSIK - Sheffield based D‚Äôn‚ÄôB DJ and Producer and more acts to be announced. 18+ only.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/love-drumnbass-hate-racism-record-junkee-tickets-66682102965">Tickets at Eventbrite</a></p>

The overall theme of the Northern site will be ‚ÄôNorthern Forest,‚Äô and for this the plan is to re-wild a patch of London with three main concept-pieces: The Beehive, The Forest and The Nest.<br />What would the wild be without its wildlife? The two costume themes will be ‚ÄòThe Birds and the Bees‚Äô and ‚ÄòNorthern Forest‚Äô Let us flex our creative Northern muscles and get as many of our rebels striped, spotted, feathered and furred as possible. Additionally any props, banners, decorations, placards and artwork that you can beg, borrow, steal, or rustle up to fit with this theme will help to make our forest a thriving hub of biodiversity, with the potential to put a smile on the face of even the most sour-faced dawn commuter.<br />If you don‚Äôt want to design your own costume, please contact  (xrworldsnorth@gmail.com) for one of the 7 giant origami animal-heads (available as pdf downloads to print at home - badgers, foxes, wolves, bears and more. If you would like to arrange local workshops or get togethers to make lots, that would be even better! They may take a bit of time to assemble, but the final result will be well worth it.<br /><br /><strong>Police Liaison</strong><br />XR Sheffield need to organise a rota of people to cover the entire 2 weeks on a shift basis.
