		<h4><a href="events/3200.html">RAF Waddington - Fly Kites not Drones</a></h4>
		<p class="info">Fri 21 Mar 2014 at RAF Waddington (coach from Sheffield)</p>
		<p class="message">Afghans celebrate their new year on the 21st March and Voices for Creative Non Violence UK is holding a weekend of solidarity with Afghan people by holding this kite flying weekend. In 2014 Afghans will be facing uncertainty and the possibility of an escalation of conflict during the re-negotiation of the international presence in Afghanistan. Kite flying has become synonymous with Afghanistan as a well loved pursuit which was banned under the Taliban. There will be a presence at the main gate on the A607 at RAF Waddington on the 21st of each month from 1pm to 3pm throughout 2014 please support them when you can.<br /><br />Secret drone strikes have been carried out by UK pilots using US drones in Afghanistan which have not been reported to Parliament. DroneWars UK released this information on February 9th.  Kareen Khan, a Pakistan drone victim was abducted on February 5th just before he was due to go to Europe to testify about drones. He was released on 14th February having been tortured.  Drone flights over Salisbury Plain are due to start shortly with the risk of crashing. While Reaper drones are flown by RAF pilots with previous experience of flying, the Watchkeeper, which is the drone in question, is operated by the army and flown by members of the Royal Artillery. The Watchkeepers have undergone test flights at Parc Aberporth in West Wales in completely segregated airspace, but the training flights will now begin from Boscombe Down airfield, an area used by piloted aircraft before flying into segregated airspace over Salisbury Plain.  This is the first time that the larger type of unmanned drones will have been regularly flown in UK airspace alongside â€˜mannedâ€™ aircraft and substantially increases the danger of a crash involving drones. Drones crash much more than piloted aircraft. DroneWars UK have recorded more than 70 crashes of the larger type of drones in the past 3 years. <br /><br />On February 11th Statewatch and the Transnational Institute published a report called Eurodrones Inc. It tells the story of how European citizens are unknowingly subsidising through their taxes a controversial drone industry yet are systematically excluded from any debates about their use. Behind empty promises of consultation, EU officials have turned over much of drone policy development to the European defence and security corporations which seek to profit from it. The current trajectory points in the direction of an increasingly militarised and repressive use of drones that will have far-reaching implications for the privacy and human rights.<br /><br />A group from Sheffield will be going to RAF Waddington on Friday 21st, if you are interested please contact Sheffield CND. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.sheffieldcnd.org.uk/">Sheffield CND website</a></p>

		<p class="info">Sat 22-Sun 23 Mar 2014, 11am-5pm</p>
		<p class="message">Green Homes Sheffield aims to give householders ideas and confidence on making their homes more energy efficient. A range of homes across the city will show features like insulation, draught-proofing, solar panels, heat pumps, energy-efficient windows and extensions, and different levels of carbon saving. They are now inviting interest from people who have made a good start on the path to a low carbon home, to consider opening their home to the public to enable others to learn from the energy-saving improvements made. Your story could help and inspire others to make changes themselves, and they hope you will enjoy sharing it.<br /><br />The initiative is part of national network <a href="http://www.greenopenhomes.net/">www.greenopenhomes.net</a><br /><br />There are 4 events during April and May 2014, after these Practice Openings. <br /><br />If you are interested, why not get in touch? There will be trained volunteers, trusted local suppliers, and lots of information and support about how to prepare, make sure everything is set up safely, and ensure necessary insurance is in place. They also provide postcards so you can invite your neighbours, signs to help visitors find your home, information leaflets relevant to your home, and on your selected days, you show people round the energy improvements in your home and tell them your story. They may have questions about which companies and technologies you used, and what it was like before, during and after the changes. Everyone learns from the experience, and more people in Sheffield start saving energy at home!<br /><br />For more details see <a href="http://www.greenhomessheffield.net/"/>www.greenhomessheffield.net</a> or email <a href="mailto:jenny.patient@regather.net">jenny.patient@regather.net</a> or call or text 07760 174335.</p>
