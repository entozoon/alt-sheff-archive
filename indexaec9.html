		<p class="info">Wed 18 Feb 2015, 9.30am-4pm, JG Graves Woodland Discovery Centre, Ecclesall Woods, Abbey Lane S7 2QZ</p>
		<p class="message">A course in the J G Graves Woodland Discovery Centre, in Ecclesall Woods. The centre runs craft courses all through the year from cider making to wood work skills.<br /><br />This course will provide you with all the materials, tools and information to create your own rustic flowerpot character, which can sit proudly in your garden or home. No flowerpot characters are the same and yours will be personalised by you by choosing the type of wood, shape of legs and type of hat! The course is set in a friendly and relaxed atmosphere and taught by Nadine Grundy, a qualified teacher who has taught arts and crafts in schools and workshops for 13 years. All the wood is sourced locally from Ecclesall Woods and is cut as part of their normal woodland management.<br /><br />Learn to use a bar auger to create holes in wood without power. Learn to use a shavehorse, a traditional woodland clamp and a drawknife to create tenons to fit the legs into the body. Learn to use a pruning saw to create the length of the body parts. Learn to use a hammer and nails to attach features such as buttons. Be creative and use paint to create an individual hat for your creation!<br /><br />Arrive 15 minutes prior to a 10am start. Depart 4pm, although this is approximate. Directions: Please look at the map featured on the website. What to bring: work clothes, pen and notebook, packed lunch. Let them know if you have any special needs. Price: Â£35.00. Refundable up to two weeks prior to course (minus Â£5 admin fee). No refunds for cancellations within two weeks of course. Lunch: bring a packed lunch. Whatâ€™s included: All timber and tool use. Refreshment and biscuits throughout the day.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ecclesallwoodscraftcourses.co.uk/">www.ecclesallwoodscraftcourses.co.uk</a></p>
