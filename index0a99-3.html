		<h4><a href="events/4116.html">Drone Network Campaign action</a></h4>
		<p class="info">Sat 3 Oct 2015, RAF Waddington: Transport from Sheffield</p>
		<p class="message">More peace activism on the heels of the recent demonstration, including participants from the Sheffield SCRAP group, who managed to close down for the day the Israeli-owned Drone factory at Shenstone near Lichfield. <br /><br />The Drone Network Campaign week of action runs from 3rd October to 12th. Sheffield campaigners will be are going to an event on the 3rd at Waddington - Scones Not Drones. This will be a national event and include Skyping, a picnic, kite flying, speeches and droning with instruments. <br /><br /><strong> From Sheffield CND latest newsletter:<br />The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament has condemned UK air strikes in Syria. These strikes have been carried out despite the House of Commons vote in August 2013 against extending air strikes to Syria. While David Cameron and Michael Fallon have both expressed support for extending the scope of the current mission, no parliamentary mandate has been sought. Fallon recently confirmed that the Government ‚Äúwill need to return to Parliament for approval if we propose to undertake air strikes against ISIL in Syria‚Äù.<br /><br />John Baron, one of the few Conservative MPs to vote against the 2003 Iraq war and action in Syria, told the Today programme ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be absolutely clear about this. We voted in 2013, when parliament had been recalled from recess, that there should be no British military intervention in Syria. We were told that No. 10 had got the message and that any future intervention would be subject to a vote. What this does show is at the very minimum an insensitivity to parliament‚Äôs will.‚Äù<br /><br />CND General Secretary Kate Hudson said:<br />‚ÄúThe Ministry of Defence claims that British troops who are embedded with foreign forces operate as if they were troops of those countries, but this is just anti-democratic doublespeak. These are British soldiers taking part in an operation which MPs voted against ... Ministers need to realise that dropping bombs from 30,000 feet will do nothing to solve the problems in Syria and Iraq.‚Äú</strong><br /><br />If you want to join the demonstration <a href="mailto:crippskath@gmail.com">contact Sheffield CND</a> so that transport can be arranged.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sheffield-Creative-Action-for-Peace-Scrap/214396975421071">SCRAP (Sheffield Creative Action for Peace)</a><br /><a href="https://dronecampaignnetwork.wordpress.com/">Drone Network Campaign</a></p>

		<p class="info">Fri 2-Sat 3 Oct 2015, 5pm-11pm, Pedlars Night Market, 156 Arundel St. S1 4RE</p>
		<p class="message">Yorkshire legends "Vintage by the Kilo" are changing the face of fashion, one kilogramme at a time. Their 'weigh-and-pay' mega-collection outsizes any charity shop, and all carefully chosen stuff, not just 'jumble'. No disrespect to charity or jumble sales, but this is mainly quality 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s clothing which would have been pricy first time round. The openings have been popping up since 1997, and this year they're at Theatre Delicatessen and other venues about twice a month. It's surely only a matter of time before they get a thrift shop of their own. Get down for a look before they're famous. <br /><br />Every second-hand purchase you make is a nail in the coffin for the fashion industry which makes corporate shareholders obscenely rich by paying exploitation wages, highly polluting from manufacture to transportation, and leading vulnerable people into expensive, illusory lives as fashion-victims. Don't believe the hype; get yer grunge gear here.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.vintagebythekilo.com/">Vintage by the Kilo</a><br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thevintagebythekilocompany">Facebook page</a></p>

		<p class="info">Sat 3 Oct 2015, 7.30pm, Old Junior School, South View Rd. S7 1DB</p>
		<p class="message">Hit and Run theatre presents "Sacked!" an original comedy about surviving the economic crisis. A tale of worker-employer relationships pushed to the limit in the age of zero-hour contracts, holiday workloads, entrenched privilege and little access to good jobs. Writer and director Mick Parkin says ‚ÄúThey even admit the system isn‚Äôt working, you can hear it on the news. But nothing‚Äôs changing.‚Äù<br /><br />‚ÄúIf you sack me, I will kill you.‚Äù  If that sounds extreme, it‚Äôs deliberate. Parkin wants to put the emotion back into the tragedy of the 2008 crash. ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs lives are being ruined on a massive scale. But the news takes all the emotion out of it. They should start each bulletin with the words ‚Äòsit down, this is really bad.‚Äô‚Äù (Words taken from an interview by Laurence Peacock.)<br /><br /> If you can't make it to Sharrow - no problem - there are other showings in Sheffield, see below; 10th and 11th October. Tickets on the door, ¬£6/¬£3 - you decide. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1603885836528675/">Facebook event page</a><br /> Enquiries email: <a href="mailto:hartsheff@aol.com">hartsheff@aol.com</a></p>
