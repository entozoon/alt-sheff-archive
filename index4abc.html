The overall theme of the Northern site will be ‚ÄôNorthern Forest,‚Äô and for this the plan is to re-wild a patch of London with three main concept-pieces: The Beehive, The Forest and The Nest.<br />What would the wild be without its wildlife? The two costume themes will be ‚ÄòThe Birds and the Bees‚Äô and ‚ÄòNorthern Forest‚Äô Let us flex our creative Northern muscles and get as many of our rebels striped, spotted, feathered and furred as possible. Additionally any props, banners, decorations, placards and artwork that you can beg, borrow, steal, or rustle up to fit with this theme will help to make our forest a thriving hub of biodiversity, with the potential to put a smile on the face of even the most sour-faced dawn commuter.<br />If you don‚Äôt want to design your own costume, please contact  (xrworldsnorth@gmail.com) for one of the 7 giant origami animal-heads (available as pdf downloads to print at home - badgers, foxes, wolves, bears and more. If you would like to arrange local workshops or get togethers to make lots, that would be even better! They may take a bit of time to assemble, but the final result will be well worth it.<br /><br /><strong>Police Liaison</strong><br />XR Sheffield need to organise a rota of people to cover the entire 2 weeks on a shift basis.
