The website, blog, social media channels and printed directory combine to form a unique experiment, a space for connecting and sharing skills, inspiration, and new kinds of knowledge.<br />
<br>Founder Andy Wilson says “The North has changed. But change isn&#39;t only a bad thing. It opens up new possibilities. Now we can make our North of England into anything we want it to be. It&#39;s up to us. We just have to say we are going to do it, and then do it. But I don&#39;t think that people and places in the North can do that only working by themselves, I think there has to be talking, sharing and cooperating.” <br />
<br>Putting these words into practice, Hannah Festival&#39;s free printed directory is distributed by fair exchange of time instead of money. Would you drop off copies of the directory at a good spot where flyers get picked up, in return for publicity about what you&#39;re involved in?</p>
