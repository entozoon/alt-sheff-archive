		<p class="message">A showcase of some fantastic surreal art from local artists over three nights, accompanied by drinks, food and great music. Entry by donation.<br /><br />N.E.C Neepsend Club is a collective of antifascist activists, artists and musicians based in Sheffield. Their goal is to halt gentrification in an area that has amazing potential to be an alternative haven. They are squatting in a beautiful semi-abandoned industrial estate, surrounded by a sea of beautiful empty buildings, which is slowly being turned into soulless student flats and hipster cafes. They aim to make this space into a community centre for gigs, art sessions and political talks. They are left anarchists and want to get as many people on board as possible, so they welcome input from anyone wanting to get involved.<br /><strong><br />N.E.C Mission Statement: At a time when homelessness, authoritarian violence and right-wing politics are ravaging not just our nation but our entire planet, organised and positive action is a necessity. We are part of the community of Neepsend. Some of us have lived round here for life. We have slowly watched our home go from being a solid working class area to an alien hostile environment. Just because we are poor the Council and heartless landlords seem to think the destruction of our identity is OK. Enough is enough. Our time for organised and positive action is now.<br /></strong></p>

		<p class="info">Thu 15 Jun 2017, 7pm, Showroom Cafe/Bar, Paternoster Row S1 2BX</p>
		<p class="message">The aim of Mini Holland was to transform the London borough of Waltham Forest into a place for cycling and walking. It introduced Dutch-style segregated cycleways and junctions, reducing traffic on residential streets and redesigning high streets to remove parking and provide space for people, not just cars.<br /><br />For its AGM, Cycle Sheffield welcomes Paul Gasson of London Cycling Campaign, a leading figure behind the scheme. Paul will provide a valuable insight into how Mini Holland has changed Waltham Forest for the better; the challenges they faced in implementing the projects and how they were able to counter the â€˜bikelashâ€™. Itâ€™s a fantastic opportunity to find out what lessons can be learnt from the Waltham Forest experience and how we can help to replicate the success in Sheffield.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.cyclesheffield.org.uk/2017/05/23/how-can-we-transform-our-city-lessons-from-londons-mini-holland/">Cycle Sheffield</a></p>

Events include panel discussions, debates, Q&As, artistic responses and keynote speeches, at various venues. It is hosted by not-for-profit social enterprise <a href="http://www.opusindependents.com/">Opus Independents</a> (which also publishes a monthly Alt-Sheff column in <a href="http://nowthenmagazine.com/sheffield/">Now Then magazine</a>).<br /><br /><a href="https://www.festivalofdebate.com/june/">Festival of Debate</a></p>
