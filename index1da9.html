		<h4><a href="events/5560.html">Frack Free Festival - Fighting Fracking on Fossil Fools Day</a></h4>
		<p class="info">Sat 30 Mar 2019, 10am till Mon 1 Apr, Harthill Village Hall</p>
		<p class="message">Family friendly weekend for local communities working together to challenge the fracking threat. Fracking has restarted in UK and multiple sites in South Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire are under imminent threat from drilling. Now is the time to learn more about fracking, network with others fighting fracking and learn how we can best protect our countryside, community and the climate!<br /><br />The Frack Free Festival will be full of workshops and skill-sharing sessions from normal people with extraordinary experience in campaigning against fracking, and dedicated trainers with years of experience. There will also be space for discussions, performances, action planning and opportunities to<br />learn what has been happening on the frontlines of frack free campaigning.<br /><br /><strong>Saturday:</strong> The full schedule of workshops on the Saturday will be released nearer the time. Some of the workshops we have confirmed so far include:<br />- How to monitor noise levels and air and water quality<br />- Fracking and Health: the health risks of fracking<br />- The Rogues Gallery and Creativity of Protests<br />- The Frack Free KM8 Campaign: how we won and what we learnt<br />- and much more!<br /><br />The will be a creative corner throughout the day to make costumes, banners, placards or bubbles! There will also be a kids area, so you can leave the little uns to play if you want to get really stuck into a workshop!<br /><br />The Saturday evening there will be music and performances and a screening of the film "The Bentley Effect" (the story of the legendary campaign that saw fracking banned in New South Wales, Australia).<br /><br /><strong>Sunday: </strong>There will be some more workshops and creative sessions in the morning before a family-friendly march through Harthill. It would be wonderful if different groups could bring their own banners so show how wide the resistance to fracking is and how we are all united!<br /><br /><strong>Monday - FOSSIL FOOLS DAY </strong>events to be confirmed.<br /><br />Veggies Catering Campaign of Nottingham will be providing wholesome food throughout the weekend on a donation basis. <br /><br />Organised by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SheffieldFrAcktion/">FrAcktion</a>, a Sheffield-based group fighting for an end to the fracking industry using creative direct action, organised skill shares and training. If you have any queries do not hesitate to get in touch at: <a href="mailto:fracktionorganisers@gmail.com">fracktionorganisers@gmail.com</a>. They can organise accommodation and advise on car-sharing or buses, for those travelling there. Also, if you would like to get involved with the coordination of the Frack Free Festival, there are lots of ways to do so before and during the festival and they would love your help! Email or come to a Monday evening meeting in Sheffield to find out how to use your skills and time (however much or little you have to offer).<br /><br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/394962114381681/">Facebook event page</a></p>

		<p class="message">Come and hear Kholoud, a well known and widely respected in Sheffield for her work promoting justice for Palestine, supporting the Sheffield Palestine Womenâ€™s Scholarship Fund and working with Northern Women for Palestine. She returns for another reason. She is a key applicant in a campaign to <strong>remove the Jewish National Fund UK (JNF UK) from the register of British charities.</strong> The JNF was founded in 1901 and played (and still does play) a major role in the ethnic cleansing and colonisation of Palestine.<br /><br />Kholoudâ€™s family are from Ajjur but were forced out in the Nakba of 1948. Since then, they have lived in Aida Camp, Bethlehem, just 25 miles from their farm lands in Ajjur, unable to return to, or even visit, what belongs to them. Their land now lies under "British Park", a leisure venue for Israelis, funded by the JNF UK.<br /><br />Kholoud has submitted her familyâ€™s title deeds to the land, as well as tax receipts, to the Charity Commission as evidence that the JNF UK is illicitly occupying her land. The Commission has rejected her case, and the detailed supportive evidence put in by members Manchester PSC and Sheffield PSC. However, they have won the right to a Tribunal appeal hearing, which will take place on Tuesday April 2nd in Manchester. <br /><br />This application to strip the JNF UK of its charitable status renews a long-standing campaign, dating back some years. The campaign is not confined to the UK but has an international dimension. In Canada, a charity supporting the Israeli army (Beth Oloth) has just lost charitable status and Stop the JNF (Canada) is actively pursuing a similar case.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.sheffieldpsc.org.uk/?tribe_events=1847">Palestine Solidarity Solidarity Campaign</a></p>
