	<p class="message">To celebrate the 175th birthday of famous Sheffield radical and LGBT icon Edward Carpenter, the newly formed Sheffield-based Millthorpe Press Co-operative is republishing some of Carpenter’s best work, starting with a new edition of his classic poem, "Towards Democracy". The edition will include the original poem and a selections of contemporary reviews and critical articles about the poem.
<br><br>
A minimum sum of £4,000 will launch Millthorpe Press and cover the costs of printing a high quality hard back edition of the poem by a local printing company. Typesetting is largely completed. All that is needed is the printing fee, and finance to launch the co-operative, so that its members can continue onto further projects.
<br><br>
In his lifetime, Edward Carpenter was a prominent literary and political radical, who wrote dozens of books, and lectured around the country, using his home at Millthorpe, near Chesterfield, as his base.
<br><br>
Though efforts have been made to remember Edward Carpenter, his writing has been largely forgotten. Even in Sheffield, for example, it is not possible to walk into a book shop and buy a copy of even Carpenter’s most famous work, but Walt Whitman’s "Leaves of Grass", the poem that inspired Carpenter to write "Towards Democracy" is on sale.

<br><br>
Millthorpe Press is a co-operative that will be largely led by its members, who will have a vote in further publications by the co-operative, as well as receiving a newsletter, and invitations to stand for its board. Ideas for future publications include Edward Carpenter: "My Days and Dreams"(1916); Carpenter’s autobiography; "Towards Democracy: The Complete Four Volume Edition" (1903); "Chants of Labour" (1888, a collection of songs and hymns, including "England Arise!"); Mary Hutton: "This Fair Isle" (a 1842 collection of political poems by a working class Sheffield woman and a rare example of a woman writing on Chartist themes); John Holland: "Sheffield Park" (1820 classic long form poem about Sheffield written by James Montgomery’s close friend).
<br><br>
So please invest, and help revive Carpenter’s legacy in Sheffield and across the world! The deadline is during December, more details at the link below.
