	<p class="message">It’s just days until the biggest protest so far planned against Morton Hall Detention Centre near Lincoln. The protest is organised by SYMAAG (South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group) and STAR (Student Action for Refugees). This is an update from SYMAAG about transport to Morton Hall, and what to expect on the day.
<br><br>
Almost 30,000 people are being taken from our communities and locked up in prison-like detention centres, without time limit, with no idea of when they might be released. Why? They just don’t have the correct immigration papers. This is unacceptable. This has to end. For more details see the website of These Walls Must Fall (<a href="https://detention.org.uk/">www.detention.org.uk</a>). 
<br><br>
<strong>On Saturday 26th October there will be a demonstration</strong> against the cruel and inhumane treatment of detainees at Morton Hall Detention Centre, in Lincolnshire. It is a prison contracted to the Home Office as an Immigration Removal Centre (IRC) as part of the UK governments "hostile environment" policy. It has room to detain 392 people, and there have been several deaths in recent years inside its walls, with nearly half the detainees feeling suicidal or depressed according to a 2017 Prison Inspectors report. 
<br><br>
Join SYMAAG, STAR, These Walls Must Fall, and many others at the demonstration. The actual protest is 12-3pm, with banners and chanting while surrounding Morton Hall (Morton Hall Village, Swinderby, Lincoln LN6 9PT). 
<br><br>
People detained at Morton Hall welcome protests, and are encouraged by them. This message was sent to SYMAAG after the last protest there, from some of the people who are detained inside:<i> “Yesterday was full of joy and atonement as we had protesters showing their solidarity for us. It was reviving to know other people are concerned with our despicable situation and support us. Thank you for braving obstacles to come to support us"</i>
<br><br>
For those who want to come to the protest but might be feeling worried about it, Student Action for Refugees have written this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SD--8hO8TGJ6eCiqij2S2CuGvrJSS7eJ5KTSEioQW4M/edit">great document about keeping safe</a> and how we will be supporting each other on the day at Morton Hall.
<br><br>
Transport: in the wider region, groups like Leeds Uni Oxfam Society, and Manchester Momentum have organised transport to Morton Hall, and everyone is welcome to join them (details below), or make your own way there.
