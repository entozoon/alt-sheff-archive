		<h4><a href="events/5555.html">Demonstration: Shut Down Morton Hall Detention Centre</a></h4>
		<p class="info">Sat 30 Mar 2019, coaches from Sheffield</p>
		<p class="message">Morton Hall Immigration Removal Centre, in Lincolnshire, is a prison contracted to the Home Office as an Immigration Removal Centre (IRC) which can detain 392 people. There have been several deaths in recent years inside its walls, with nearly half the detainees feeling suicidal or depressed according to a 2017 Prison Inspectors report. <br /><br />Join South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG), Sheffield Student Action for Refugees (STAR), Sheffield Labour Students and These Walls Must Fall, to protest against the cruel and inhumane treatment of detainees at Morton Hall. <br /><br />Morton Hall is where our Zimbabwean friends from South Yorkshire, Victor, Khuzani and Benji, were detained and threatened with deportation last month. A huge campaign secured their release and halted the Home Office deportation plans. This demonstation will build on that success. In October 2018, Sheffield organisations were among many who surrounded Morton Hall to show solidarity with those inside. They continue to campaign to bring an end to the racist and oppressive institution of detention in the UK. This is a return visit with more numbers, more banners and more noise to demand that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/no-one-listened-now-four-11964977">this grim place</a> is shut down for good. <br /><br />For more information look <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2082321161821146/">here</a>. There is coach travel going from Sheffield (free tickets are available to those who need them, or ¬£11.25-¬£16.58) please click the link below. <br /><br /><a href="https://shutdownmortonhall.eventbrite.co.uk/">shutdownmortonhall.eventbrite.co.uk</a>.</p>

		<p class="info">Sat 30 Mar 2019, 10am till Mon 1 Apr, Harthill Village Hall</p>
		<p class="message">Family friendly weekend for local communities working together to challenge the fracking threat. Fracking has restarted in UK and multiple sites in South Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire are under imminent threat from drilling. Now is the time to learn more about fracking, network with others fighting fracking and learn how we can best protect our countryside, community and the climate!<br /><br />The Frack Free Festival will be full of workshops and skill-sharing sessions from normal people with extraordinary experience in campaigning against fracking, and dedicated trainers with years of experience. There will also be space for discussions, performances, action planning and opportunities to<br />learn what has been happening on the frontlines of frack free campaigning.<br /><br /><strong>Saturday:</strong> The full schedule of workshops on the Saturday will be released nearer the time. Some of the workshops we have confirmed so far include:<br />- How to monitor noise levels and air and water quality<br />- Fracking and Health: the health risks of fracking<br />- The Rogues Gallery and Creativity of Protests<br />- The Frack Free KM8 Campaign: how we won and what we learnt<br />- and much more!<br /><br />The will be a creative corner throughout the day to make costumes, banners, placards or bubbles! There will also be a kids area, so you can leave the little uns to play if you want to get really stuck into a workshop!<br /><br />The Saturday evening there will be music and performances and a screening of the film "The Bentley Effect" (the story of the legendary campaign that saw fracking banned in New South Wales, Australia).<br /><br /><strong>Sunday: </strong>There will be some more workshops and creative sessions in the morning before a family-friendly march through Harthill. It would be wonderful if different groups could bring their own banners so show how wide the resistance to fracking is and how we are all united!<br /><br /><strong>Monday - FOSSIL FOOLS DAY </strong>events to be confirmed.<br /><br />Veggies Catering Campaign of Nottingham will be providing wholesome food throughout the weekend on a donation basis. <br /><br />Organised by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SheffieldFrAcktion/">FrAcktion</a>, a Sheffield-based group fighting for an end to the fracking industry using creative direct action, organised skill shares and training. If you have any queries do not hesitate to get in touch at: <a href="mailto:fracktionorganisers@gmail.com">fracktionorganisers@gmail.com</a>. They can organise accommodation and advise on car-sharing or buses, for those travelling there. Also, if you would like to get involved with the coordination of the Frack Free Festival, there are lots of ways to do so before and during the festival and they would love your help! Email or come to a Monday evening meeting in Sheffield to find out how to use your skills and time (however much or little you have to offer).<br /><br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/394962114381681/">Facebook event page</a></p>
