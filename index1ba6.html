		<h4><a href="events/5284.html">Justified and Ancient: the value of trees in cities</a></h4>
		<p class="info">Sat 23 Jun 2018, 1.45-5pm, Freeman College, Sterling Works, 88 Arundel St. S1 2NG</p>
		<p class="message">Sheffield City Councilâ€™s decision to remove half of the cityâ€™s 35,000 trees has been met with shock and anger. The response by thousands of local people has shown just how much Sheffieldâ€™s trees are valued and loved. How can we ensure decision makers appreciate the importance of trees - especially ancient trees - for the well-being of communities, wildlife and the environment in urban landscapes? How can local communities be consulted and supported to plant and care for trees? This annual event will bring together experts and activists from a range of civil society groups to discuss the varied relationships between people and trees in the urban environment.<br /><br />Speakers:<br /><strong>Ted Green MBE</strong>, Ancient Tree Forum: a regular broadcaster, writer and speaker at international conferences on ancient trees and fungi, founder member and President of the Ancient Tree Forum and Honorary Vice President of International Tree Foundation.<br /><strong>Dr Nicola Dempsey</strong>, University of Sheffield, Department of Landscape; research interests relate to understanding the complex relationship between landscape and humans, focussing on sustainable landscape planning and management and its impact on quality of life and wellbeing. Her current research project is on place-keeping, which she defines as â€˜long-term and flexible management of green and open spaces to ensure they can be enjoyed by all users now and in the futureâ€™.<br /><strong>Fran Halsall</strong>, Sheffield Tree Action Group (STAG); founder member of the Sheffield Woodland Connections project. She is a vocal advocate for urban trees and works for Sheffield Tree Action Group in communications and outreach, as well as editing the Save Sheffield Trees website.<br /><strong>Alison Teal</strong>, Sheffield Green Party Councillor on Sheffield City Council. Alison has been an active member of Save Nether Edge Trees since 2015. She has faced arrest and legal action for her attempts to protect healthy trees from felling.<br /><strong>Sue Pitt</strong>, Fruit-full Communities, ITF: Based in Sheffield, Sue has responsibility for delivering ITFâ€™s contribution to the Fruit-full Communities Project, now in its third year. Sue is particularly interested in how planting and growing can promote confidence, health and wellbeing as well as providing economically and environmentally sustainable futures for communities.<br /><strong>Annette Taberner</strong>, Street Tree Art Sheffield (STARTS): What began as a few friends meeting on a street corner to paint a picture of a much loved, threatened street tree has blossomed into a project which has attracted hundreds of people and encouraged them to spend time appreciating trees, creating art work, making friends and raising awareness of the importance of our green environment to health and wellbeing.<br /><br />Programme:<br />13:45 Arrival & Registration<br />14.00 Welcome & Introduction<br />14.15 Speakers & Discussion<br />16.00 Social and drinks<br />17.00 END<br /><br />Directions: the venue is the Dining Room of Freeman College; enter through Fusion CafÃ© where you will be met and directed to the Dining Room.<br />By rail: Leave from the main entrance of Sheffield Railway Station (not where the trams run at the back of the station) and walk up past the water feature to the main road. Cross over and head straight up the hill along Howard Street, which is pedestrianised. Turn left onto Arundel Street at the Globe Inn. Fusion cafÃ© is on the right hand side, about 150m along Arundel Street.<br />By car: There is a multi-story car park at the station which is easy to find if you are unfamiliar with the city by following signs to the station. On leaving the car park, walk along to the front of the station and then follow the directions above. Other cheaper car parks near the venue include Matilda Street and Sidney Street carparks which can be found <a href="https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/home/parking/car-parks">here</a>.<br /><br />For further information please contact ITF <a href="mailto:info@internationaltreefoundation.org">info@internationaltreefoundation.org</a>. This is a free event. Places are limited, so please book your ticket early to avoid disappointment.<br /><br /><a href="https://the-value-of-trees-in-cities.eventbrite.co.uk/">Eventbrite booking page</a></p>
