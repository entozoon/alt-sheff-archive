		<td>The aim of Mini Holland was to transform the London borough of Waltham Forest into a place for cycling and walking. It introduced Dutch-style segregated cycleways and junctions, reducing traffic on residential streets and redesigning high streets to remove parking and provide space for people, not just cars.

For its AGM, Cycle Sheffield welcomes Paul Gasson of London Cycling Campaign, a leading figure behind the scheme. Paul will provide a valuable insight into how Mini Holland has changed Waltham Forest for the better; the challenges they faced in implementing the projects and how they were able to counter the ‘bikelash’. It’s a fantastic opportunity to find out what lessons can be learnt from the Waltham Forest experience and how we can help to replicate the success in Sheffield.
