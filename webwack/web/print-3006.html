		<td>Fundraising gig for &#39;Peace in the Park&#39;, the annual festival promoting peace and understanding by bringing together communities through artistic, musical and vocal expression. &#39;Peace in the Park&#39; is organised by a group of artists, musicians, students, events organisers and other everyday Sheffield folk, working together in a not for profit collective.

This promises to be an awesome weekend event, it includes clothes swap and crafty workshops (daytime Sat) a pop-up record shop (daytime Sun) and designer makers, live art/graffiti and barbeque. Plus bands and spoken word performances throughout the day and night!

Tickets are Â£4 (with 25% going to PITP) and this include access to everything else that&#39;s going on as well as the fabulous raffle to raise money, and you can increase your chances of winning prizes by buying more raffle tickets throughout the weekend.
