		<td>A protest has been called against a visit arranged by Sheffield International Venues, of US preacher Franklin Graham, accused of being homophobic and Islamaphobic.

Councillors warned organisers that the visit could lead to protests, and the Bishop of Sheffield, Pete Wilcox, said "Mr Graham’s rhetoric is repeatedly and unnecessarily inflammatory and in my opinion represents a risk to the social cohesion of our city."
