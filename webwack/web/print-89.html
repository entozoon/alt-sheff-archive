		<td>Forget the throw-away culture, many broken things can be repaired. Repair cafes are run by Repair Sheffield, on one Saturday every alternating month. A group of dedicated volunteers spend free time repairing everyday items such as vacuum cleaners, sewing machines, radios, and toys and gadgets. 

They are joined by BitFIXit, a group of volunteers and professionals which has been fixing computers since 2005 on a not-for-profit ’Pay-As-You-Can’ basis.
