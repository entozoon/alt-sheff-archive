		<td>Weâ€™ve been presented with austerity as though there is no alternative. But austerity has failed and there are many alternatives. This open discussion brings together a panel of experts to explore alternatives to austerity which would benefit the whole population, rather than the richest few, whilst helping our economy become more sustainable and debt free. Audience members will also be invited to contribute suggestions before voting on their top ten policy ideas.

The Festival of Debate is taking place in Sheffield in the run-up to the general election, during March and April. It provides opportunities to get together and discuss a range of issues which affect everyone. Informed decision making and strategic planning are essential for democracy, so come and get involved. They also welcome volunteers, from attending events and taking part in discussions to volunteering time to help run an event, promote the festival and much more. Unless otherwise stated events are free to attend, but if possible please register via the appropriate Eventbrite link on the Festival of Debate website below to give organisers an idea of numbers.
