		<td>Sheffield residents of all faiths and none are to take part in a walkabout of the cityâ€™s places of worship. The sixth annual 'Peace Walk' will be a celebration of Sheffield's diverse communities and a show of unity and solidarity in opposition to the racist politics of the British National Party and English Defence League, who seek to divide our city.

The walk is leaving St. Cuthbert's Church in Fir Vale at 2pm and arriving at Al-Rahman Mosque in Burngreave at around 3.30pm.  Participants will observe a moment of prayer or reflection at each of the seven places of worship along the route.  All are welcome to join.</td>
