		<td>This coming year Sheffield Palestinian Solidarity Campaign (SPSC) are again going to have regular boycott actions on the first Saturday of each month, raising awareness of the fight for justice in Palestine. 

Following the Boycott Hewlett Packard national day of action in November, they are going to focus on this campaign. Staples sells Hewlett Packard products so SPSC plans to tell them about the company and why they should not stock their products. Followed by a walk up to the Town Hall with banner, arriving about 12 noon.

HP, while claiming to uphold values of social responsibility, is notorious for involvement in oppressive practices worldwide including breaches of international law in Palestine. It sells biometric permit systems for Palestinians, installed in Israeli military checkpoints, and technology to the Israeli armed services enabling the deadly blockade of the Gaza Strip. Also it supplies services to the Israeli Prison Services which illegally imprison Palestinians including children, and IT developments in illegal Israeli Settlements.
