		<td>We all know things aren’t right and it’s time to make a choice about what matters. It’s not who we are underneath, but what we do that defines us. The time has come for you to decide what really matters in your world. If we want things to be different, then you have to choose what change to instigate, when to act and who you’re going to work with to make it stick. It’s the only way to take back your power, start restoring some degree of fairness and give our future a chance. Come and find the inspiration for where to draw your line in the sand... Tickets at <a href="http://pknsheff17.eventbrite.com/">www.pknsheff17.eventbrite.com</a>. £6 standing, £9 table.

The Festival of Debate is taking place in Sheffield in the run-up to the General election, during March and April. It provides opportunities to get together and discuss a range of issues which affect everyone. Informed decision making and strategic planning are essential for democracy, so come and get involved.
