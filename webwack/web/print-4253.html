		<td>A talk by Chris Clements, who holds a degree in Ecology and is currently a PhD student at the University of Sheffield.

Elegantly simple, the theory of evolution is one of the most widely supported hypotheses ever put forward, so why all the fuss? Ranging from a lack of grasping geological time to conflict with religious and personal beliefs the reasons for evolution denial are varied, but ultimately unfounded. This talk aims to highlight some of the main misconceptions.

Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. Talks are typically about a common belief that can be demonstrated to be false or cannot be justified by the available evidence. The events are free though they ask for a Â£2 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
