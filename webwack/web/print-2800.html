		<td>The discussion of who should create our money supply and how that can best be done has a long and often under-recognised history. This talk and open discussion seeks to explore the place of the Positive Money campaign in the context of a recurring debate which has taken place in different centuries and on different continents.

The talk is given by a long-standing member of the Sheffield group, who is an authority on the history of money and debt.

Refreshments (50p) from 7.15pm, meeting from 7.30 - 9.00pm. Voluntary donation (suggested £3) to cover costs. Organised by the Sheffield group of Positive Money supporters.

“If you want to be slaves of the bankers, and pay the costs of your own slavery, then let the banks create money” (Josiah Stamp, director of the Bank of England 1937)
