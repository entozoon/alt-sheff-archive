		<td>The annual festival, this year with a bigger and better line up and general plans for the event to become a key annual fixture of the region. Two days of music across 5 stages, Arts & Crafts Market, Heritage Craft Workshops, Site Gallery Introducing Stage, Tree Fayre, Children’s activities, Forest school, local food & drink and lots more! Set in a stunning river and woodland location at Endcliffe Park, organised by Regather. A very family-friendly festival, the Concerteenies Stage exclusively for 0-3 year olds and their grown-ups gives audiences the unique opportunity to hear live, quality music in a baby-and-toddler-friendly environment, with informal introductions and set alongside sensory activities for little ones, including bubbles, colourful ribbons and little-hands percussion.

Sheffield’s Site Gallery returns for their ‘Introducing’ stage and Video Art Tent, presenting a fantastic line-up of contemporary performance, music and video art, commissioned and selected by and for young people in Sheffield. All activity will be curated and produced in collaboration with the Society of Explorers, Site Gallery art collective of 14-19 year olds who are encouraging young people to express their interest.

Other attractions include: a forest school run by Middlewood Nature Nursery, with free positive outdoor experiences in the woods; a kids’ area packed full of activities and organised games; and an expanded arts & crafts market with some of the best local craftspeople showcasing their work.

The popular Heritage Craft Workshops will return, meaning opportunities to work with and learn from some of the finest crafts people in the area, including blacksmiths, woodworkers, and wool spinners. Workshops can be booked in advance at the link below.

New for 2019 is the Tree Fayre - a celebration of trees! This new area will provide opportunities to meet tree scientists, artists, climbers and thinkers, and be amazed and inspired by Britain’s biggest plants. Join them for a programme of walks, talks and things to do, all about trees, woodlands and the wildlife that inhabits them. 

As usual you can expect Sheffield’s world-famous beer scene on full display in various beer tents. The event will also feature a wide range of top-quality independent food traders from across Sheffield. Folk Forest organisers Regather will also be showcasing their latest small batch craft beer and seasonal cider, fresh from their very own onsite brewery at The Regather Works. Regather’s co-op structure and focus on local, independent values-driven business models is a major part of the festival and the people involved, with the event celebrating the best of Sheffield, local partners, suppliers and traders.
