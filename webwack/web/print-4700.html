		<td>This is a repeat of the very popular course delivered in September, a non-technical look at how you can make your website more effective - without spending lots of money. This course will help you to think about what your service users, funders and potential partners want from your website. Learn how to make your site search engine friendly. Understand how to shape and write content to help everyone access the information they need.

As a follow-on, you may be interested in attending the Social Media in the Not-for-Profit Sector course which will run in the afternoon on the same date of this course.

The course will also be repeated on 8 February 2011. Course fee - £40 for VAS members, £45 for non member voluntary and community groups, and £80 for all others including people wishing to attend as individual and not on behalf of an organisation. 

One of a number of courses in an excellent rolling programme by <a href="http://www.vas.org.uk/training/courses">Voluntary Action Sheffield</a></td>
