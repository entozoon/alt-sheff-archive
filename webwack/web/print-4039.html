		<td>Mike Lawrence presents a talk exposing the link between primitive astronomy/astrology and modern day religious theology. It aims to demonstrate how all theology is inexorably linked with ancient astrological perceptions, and ultimately, the folly of theological worship. His purpose is not to discredit the benefit many people gain from following a theological belief, but to provoke lively debate on the future role of religion in the public realm of politics and education given theology&#39;s demonstrably fictitious foundation.

Mike has given this talk to Humanists and Secular societies across the UK with really good receptions. It promises to be a thought provoking look at the conflict between the myth of &#39;Jesus Christ&#39; and the historic reality, for anyone with an interest in the history of religion and the origins of Christianity. A talk open to the public, all welcome. 

University Arms is near Sheffield University tram stop, or bus: 51 & 52 best; 94 & 95 close by). Map of the location: <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=university+arms+sheffield">http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=university+arms+sheffield</a>
