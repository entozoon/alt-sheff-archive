LaDIYFest Sheffield is a DIY, anti-capitalist, community based, feminist festival run by volunteers, led primarily by women but all are welcome to get involved. It aims to highlight female and LGBTQ art, projects and activism in the community, promoting social change in a non-discriminatory environment through music, performance art, spoken word, films, discussions, art exhibitions and practical workshops etc. 

Donations around £4/5 on the door, but no one will be turned away for lack of funds.
