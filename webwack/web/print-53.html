		<td>Monday 27th January 2020 marks 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz, yet we still have genocides, wars, fascism and borders. The UK government is committing atrocities by detaining refugees in immigration centres and sending them back to the countries that they fled. The right of refugees to seek sanctuary in the UK is too often judged by their willingness to assimilate and their ability to contribute to the economy.

 Meet at Hartshead Square 5.45pm to demand sanctuary for all refugees, with a vigil at Vulcan House and following discussion on the UK treatment of Jewish refugees in the 1930s and 1940s.

Organised by If Not Now Then, and Sheffield Student Action for Refugees (STAR)
