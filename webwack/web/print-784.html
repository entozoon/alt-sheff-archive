		<td>This is a five day theatre and arts festival held during Refugee Week. Its aim is to celebrate diversity and recognise the positive impact migration has on the city. It brings together people, talks, exhibitions and performers from many communities, and welcomes you to come and show Sheffield is a friendly and supportive city. Many people who aren’t familiar with the injustices of the asylum system say how important this festival is.

Performance highlights this year include ‘An Evening with an Immigrant’, by Nigerian-born Inua Ellams, and the new play ‘Borderline’, by PSYCHEdelight. Musical treats from Syria, Southern Africa, Congo, and much more. It will be one of the final seasons based in the current home of Theatre Delicatessen, 17 The Moor, S1 3LR, before it moves out to allow for redevelopment of the old Woolworths shop.
