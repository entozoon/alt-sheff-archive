		<td>Sheffield no longer holds an Anarchist Bookfair (<a href="https://sheffieldbookfair.org.uk.archived.website/">since 2017</a>) so this is worth travelling to, especially because it’s held this year at the People’s History Museum which is interesting in itself, and it’s in central Manchester. 

Manchester & Salford Anarchist Bookfair (formerly the Manchester Radical Bookfair) is for anyone interested in finding out more about anarchism and anarchist ideas. As well as books there will be talks, flyers, freebies, and probably an after-party. A free event.
