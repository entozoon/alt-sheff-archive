		<td>Positive Money Sheffield has organised this important public meeting find out about the Government’s plans to create £70 billion of new money which is being given to the financial sector. 

What is Quantitative Easing anyway? The Bank of England has spent an enormous amount of money – £375 billion – on Quantitative Easing (QE), and is going to add £70 billion more. Positive Money is campaigning against this, and even the Prime Minister has complained about its “bad side effects” and said “A change has got to come”.  How is QE supposed to work, what’s wrong with it, and could it be replaced with something else?
 
The speaker – Mike Black – has supported Positive Money since it started in 2010, after years of trying to work out for himself how our strange banking system operates.

Positive Money ask for a £3 per head donation – just to cover costs. This will be the final Positive Money Sheffield meeting of 2016 and the first one being held by the new core group.
