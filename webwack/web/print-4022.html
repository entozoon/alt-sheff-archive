		<td>Do you like to sing, or do you just like hearing beautiful music? ASSIST Sheffield is putting on a &#39;Big Sing&#39; led by the master of music at St Marie&#39;s Cathedral, Philip Jakob, who is a member of the Iona Community. The music is mainly from the Christian tradition but everyone is welcome whatever their faith. No singing talent is needed! You may want to join in or just sit and listen to the music in quiet reflection. There is no charge, although there will be an opportunity to make a donation to ASSIST&#39;s work.
