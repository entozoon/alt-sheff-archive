		<td>Sheffield Save Our NHS is fighting the appalling government plans for cuts, competition and privatization for the benefit of private companies. The Health and Social Care Bill is now very close to becoming an Act. Lib Dem peers did not press their amendments after accepting various &#39;assurances&#39; from the Government and voted heavily against David Owen&#39;s amendment that the Bill should not go through until the Risk Register is published. More or less the same happened in the House of Commons which then passed all the Lords amendments. BUT THE NHS IS NOT KILLED OFF YET. Resistance to the Lansley treatment just has to take new forms. This meeting is for planning the next steps - there is a lot to discuss - be part of it!
