		<td>Sheffield City Council has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/12/sheffield-council-backs-universal-basic-income-trial">passed a motion</a> giving its support to a pilot of Universal Basic Income (UBI) in the city. Sheffield could become the first English city to trial universal basic income. Join this UBI Lab Meet-up with a speaker for the first hour, and Working Group Update for the second hour.

Jason Leman, Chair of UBI Lab Sheffield, says "Sheffield has a long history of leading radical change, from the Chartists through to the Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire. We don’t know if a Universal Basic Income is the answer to the problems we face, but a pilot will give us the much-needed evidence about what works. Having a real safety net seems to help people’s health and wellbeing. It helps people who are looking after their family and it could also give people the confidence to retrain, volunteer or become entrepreneurs."
