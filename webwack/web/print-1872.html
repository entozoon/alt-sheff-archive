		<td>Why are there still people rough sleeping in 2015? A discussion led by a panel and audience questions and answers, examining the issues facing people who sleep rough or in temporary, unsuitable or vulnerable housing. The event will also hear from people affected in this way, about the actions they would like to see to address these issues, as well as ways to overcome barriers to political engagement. In association with Big Issue in the North, SAVE and Roundabout.

The Festival of Debate is taking place in Sheffield in the run-up to the General election, during March and April. It provides opportunities to get together and discuss a range of issues which affect everyone. Informed decision making and strategic planning are essential for democracy, so come and get involved. They also welcome volunteers, from attending events and taking part in discussions to volunteering time to help run an event, promote the festival and much more. Unless otherwise stated events are free to attend, but if possible please register via the appropriate Eventbrite link on the Festival of Debate website below to give organsisers an idea of numbers.
