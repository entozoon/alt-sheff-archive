		<th>Details</th>
		<td>April 1st saw the implementation of the Health and Social Care Act and the introduction of regulations forcing competitive tender for NHS services wherever possible. Already private companies are carving out huge slices. Financial pressure on the NHS will increase the burden on staff and make the NHS still more vulnerable to competition. However THE NHS IS NOT KILLED OFF YET.

Get involved, show your support for the NHS.
