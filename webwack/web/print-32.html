		<td>Find out about Extinction Rebellion, who they are, what it does, why it exists, what it is trying to achieve and how you can join. The planet is in ecological crisis: we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction event this planet has experienced. Scientists believe we may have entered a period of abrupt climate breakdown. This is an unprecedented global emergency. 

In this public talk, members of Extinction Rebellion Sheffield will share the latest climate science on where our planet is heading, discuss some of the current psychology around climate change, and offer solutions through the study of social movements. Everyone is welcome and there will be plenty of time to ask questions and discuss afterwards. Entry is free but please donate towards venue hire costs if you can.

Please aim to arrive at 6.45 for a prompt start at 7pm.
