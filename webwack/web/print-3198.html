An invitation to share a meal, and then to make a donation, to fund raise for <a href="http://www.assistsheffield.org.uk/">Assist</a>. This is the Sheffield-based charity that tries to look after asylum seekers and to make sure, amongst other services, that those who cannot go back home but also are not allowed to work or claim benefit (i.e. are effectively destitute) receive some small amount of money each week to feed themselves. 
 
3 Course Dinner with a glass of wine : Â£26 donation. Vegetarians catered for. Other diets please enquire in advance. (NB This follows a similar event on 15th March.)
 
Would you like to go? Contact for details or to reserve a place: Vicky Seddon <a href="mailto:vseddon@btinternet.com">vseddon@btinternet.com</a></td>
