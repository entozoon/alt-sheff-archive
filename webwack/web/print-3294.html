		<td>Join the global strike on violence against women! 50% of women in England and Wales will experience violence, sexual assault or stalking in their lifetime. Sheffield is taking part in a global campaign to bring an end to violence against women. More than 25 local organisations, as well as many individuals, have come together for the Sheffield Rising initiative, supporting the global campaign One Billion Rising <a href="http://www.onebillionrising.org/">www.onebillionrising.org</a> which aims to promote awareness about violence against women through a variety of creative activities for February 14th 2013.

Flash-mob dance-along 1.00pm & 1.30pm (repeated slots).

Learn an easy routine to "Break The Chain", the athem for One Billion Rising. The routine has been adapted from the orginal choreography by Debbie Allen. Everyone from any background can join in, no dance experience required, young, old, female or male. Don&#39;t think you want to dance? Come and support and clap and cheer! 

Rehearsals where you can learn the routine with Nisha & Jenny are being held at Nycha Dance Studio, Edgedale Road, S7 2BQ, final one 6.30pm Sunday 10th Feb. You only need to attend one rehearsal as a minumum as you will probably learn the routine in one session. £1 minimum donation requested towards hall hire & rest going to the charity.

The initiative is supported by organisations including Aim to Dance, Belrobics, CND, City of Sanctuary, Northern Refugee Centre, Sheffield Feminist Network, Sheffield University S.U. Women’s Committee, VIDA and the Workers Educational Association.

Note there is also a performance on Friday night as part of the Sheffield Rising initiative - details below.
