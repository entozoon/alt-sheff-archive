		<td>Side by Side is a user-led community drama group which aims to promote inter-cultural understanding, integration and cohesion between people of all social, ethnic, cultural and faith backgrounds, whilst raising awareness about the positive contributions that refugees and asylum seekers can make. They use drama as a tool for building confidence, developing self-expression and building friendships, as well as exploring themes that are important and relevant to their members. In the current climate of intercultural hostilities, they offer proof that people of many different backgrounds can work together, from the bottom-up, in a unified, cohesive way to create something positive and fun.

'Communicatease' is an expression of the group's collective voice, and comes from months of devising, exploring and sharing ideas. It is a collection of stories in all their diverse colours, from traditional folktales to personal experiences, from fantasy to the downright bizarre.

Entrance free, Sharrow Community Forum is at Old Junior School, South View Road S7 1DB.
