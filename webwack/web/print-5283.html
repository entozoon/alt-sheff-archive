		<td>The Cuba Cycle challenge is 355 km ride over 6 days in Cuba in April/May. Sue Clarke and Ros Wollen are undertaking it, covering their own travel and accommodation costs. They aim to raise £2600 to be paid directly into the MUSIC FUND FOR CUBA to support two projects in Havana; essential educational and musical equipment for a school for visually impaired children, and the ongoing restoration of the Miramar community theatre. 

Join them for this fundraiser: A four course meal starting with a "Mojito" Cuban Cocktail, followed by a starter, main course and desert, finishing with Cuban coffee and home made chocolates! Enjoy a great meal with friends, or buy the meal as a present for someone. There's even a music quiz for all to join in! Cost £18 per head.
