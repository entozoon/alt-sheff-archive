		<td>What happens when you meet someone who has fled their country to seek refuge in the UK? What happens when that person becomes your friend and needs your help? Drawn from real life conversations, Asylum Dialogues explores the everyday encounters between asylum seekers and British people, encouraging us to challenge our own preconceptions.

"We regularly hear about the terrible hostility that asylum seekers and refugees face. But we rarely hear the stories of British people who are standing shoulder to shoulder with those seeking sanctuary in the UK. Asylum Dialogues tells these inspirational stories and shows how small gestures of welcome can make a big difference."
Juliet Stevenson

Ice and Fire creates compelling theatre making real and relevant the impact of human rights issues on our everyday lives. Asylum Dialogues is performed by members of their national outreach network, Actors for Human Rights, made up of over 300 professional actors dedicated to drawing public attention to a range of contemporary human rights concerns. The actors and musicians involved volunteer their performance skills and public profile to encourage public acceptance of human rights laws and principles and to give voice to people whose basic human rights have been violated.

An Amnesty International event with STAR (Student action for refugees) Free, but donations are welcome for local refugee and asylum charities. Includes a post-show panel and Q & A
