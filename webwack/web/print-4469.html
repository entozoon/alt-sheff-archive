		<td>The publication of US diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks provides an invaluable insight into the real state of international relations, the plots, conspiracies and crimes of the United States and other governments, and the mounting global tensions that threaten to spark new military conflicts.

The organisationâ€™s founder, Julian Assange, has faced death threats from US politicians and media figures as well as calls for his trial and execution.

The British authorities are participating in efforts to extradite Assange to Sweden on trumped-up sex charges, where he will almost certainly face extradition to the US and a possible death sentence.

Much of what passes for the liberal or 'left' wing has either joined in the right-wing campaign against Assange or, in what amounts to the same thing, are silent as to the grave threat to democratic rights that is posed by this counter-attack by the imperialist powers.

One of a series of meetings around the country. For more details see <a href="http://wsws.org/articles/2011/feb2011/ukwi-f05.shtml">wsws.org/articles/2011/feb2011/ukwi-f05.shtml</a></td>
