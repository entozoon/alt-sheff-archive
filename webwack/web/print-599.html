		<td>Advances in AI and robotics will destroy many paid jobs in the coming decades with potentially catastrophic effects on society. Various ideas for reforming the economic system could help us survive this forthcoming revolution, these include a Universal Basic Income and IOUnet - an exchange system where citizens create their own credit. The speaker for the evening will be Simon Thorpe, who is Research Director at CNRS in Toulouse.
