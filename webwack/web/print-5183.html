		<td>All welcome to visit the stall and sign a letter to their MP asking her/him to sign Early Day Motion 144 calling for an end to the development of a new generation of Trident nuclear weapons and for the government to sign the Nuclear Weapons Convention document drafted in 1997, which provides a plan for the controlled abolition of all nuclear weapons.
This would be an important constructive step preceding the forthcoming Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty meeting in May 2010. This treaty calls for both nuclear non-proliferation and abolition and so far nothing of substance has been done regarding either situation by the UK. In fact, Trident renewal breaks the spirit of this Treaty.

All women welcome to join this vigil.
