		<td>The 2019 May Day Boycott Action will again be outside HSBC on Fargate, with Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign (SPSC). They are now focusing particularly on Caterpillar whose equipment has a long history in the oppression of people in Palestine. Rachel Corrie, a member of International Solidarity Movement, was crushed by a Caterpillar D9 while trying to prevent the demolition of a Palestinian home.

SPSC are calling on HSBC to divest from Caterpillar. Join them outside HSBC on Fargate to tell the bank and the people of Sheffield that while the bank continues to invest in Caterpillar they are supporting Israeli war crimes.

Other activities for May Day:

    1.00pm  SPSC will be joining Sheffield’s May Day March and rally with a banner and Palestinian flags. Assemble 1pm at Devonshire Green. Listen out for a group singing the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3orfG--JhHI&amp;feature=youtu.be">Eurovision Boycott song!</a> 

    2.00pm Rally at Barkers Pool. Speakers include Len McClusky Gen Secretary of Unite, and Musheir El Farrar of SPSC.

     3.00pm join a group for a visit to BBC Sheffield to hand in a letter complaining about the BBC’s involvement in broadcasting and hosting this year’s Eurovision Song Contest taking place in Tel Aviv, Israel.</td>
