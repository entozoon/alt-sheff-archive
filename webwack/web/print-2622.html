		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Jungle Lion return to the Notty House for an evening of packed sweaty skanking, with more than a hint of righteous Reggae in honour of Bob Marley&#39;s birthday (his birthday&#39;s actually on the 6th, but as his legacy resonates through history it&#39;s ok to have a party on the 8th). Jungle Lion will be playing a few of the great man&#39;s tunes mixed in with their usual belting ska intensity. Get your most absorbent dancing pants on, see you on the 8th!

The gig is FREE, but they will be encouraging everyone to make a voluntary donation of Â£2 on the door that will be given to help fund Peace in the Park and Sharrow Festival.
