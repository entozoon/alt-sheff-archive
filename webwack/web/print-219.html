		<td>The largest private multinational company in the UK is set to try and defeat the small village of Woodsetts, in South Yorkshire. In round 3 of the battle against fracking, a public inquiry opens on Tuesday 11 June, in Rotherham. 

The local Woodsetts community believed they were safe from the dangers of fracking, after Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council twice turned down INEOS applications for exploratory drilling at local planning level. INEOS appealed to the national planning inspectorate to overturn the decision, hence the public inquiry.

Local people are hoping the inquiry will see the back of INEOS. Woodsetts resident of 50 years, Richard Scholey, says “Our village has spoken and said no to fracking in Woodsetts, or anywhere else, and our elected councillors have said no twice. I’m outraged that INEOS have the arrogance to come back again, in an attempt to force their plans on us against our will, and against the democratic processes we have in place. There are Local Authority homes designated for use by the elderly and most vulnerable in our community, right next to the proposed site, and we don’t want the rest of these peoples’ lives to be blighted by this industrial monstrosity.”

David Burley of Frack Free South Yorkshire says “We know that fracking isn’t the right thing for any village – from HGV traffic congestion, to noisy industrial activity and increased air pollution – this is the wrong move at the very time we know we need to move away from fossil fuels. With a 30 year license, this one well could lead to many wells all around the area for decades to come. We understand the far-reaching impacts of fracking on the environment and peoples’ health, and we really hope for a positive result for Woodsetts in this inquiry.” 

Local people have put their own money into a <a href="https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/woodsetts-anti-fracking-fighting-fund/">fundraising campaign</a> to pay for barristers and experts to challenge INEOS at this Inquiry. They are David fighting Goliath; taking on a multinational company which puts growth and profit before people and the planet. 

Woodsetts Against Fracking are hoping to gather a huge crowd in Rotherham on Tuesday 11 June, from 9am, at Riverside House. They will also be appealing for help from around the globe through a creative social media campaign.
