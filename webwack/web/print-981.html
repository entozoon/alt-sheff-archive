		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Hewlett Packard (HP) is one of the world’s largest IT companies. It’s one of the main suppliers to the Israeli military and security sectors, and to some settlements, playing a key role in the occupation and the violation of Palestinian rights.

From the 25th November to 3rd December there is a global week of action to hold HP accountable. (See this <a href="https://youtu.be/qWbu4Dmvbxo">video on YouTube</a>). In Britain there is a national day of action on Saturday 26th November. This is also  a celebration of <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/palestinianday/">the UN Day of solidarity with Palestinian people</a>.

Join Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign in the city centre outside John Lewis, a provider of HP products, to let the public know what HP are really like. After the action they will be joining a rally outside the Town Hall. The campaign is also asking people to <a href="http://stophp.uk/">sign a pledge (here)</a> saying that they will not buy HP products in the future. Please sign yourself, and pass the link on to your friends.
