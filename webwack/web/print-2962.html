		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes.

This month, ride to sites associated with or named in the songs of Richard Hawley, Pulp and Arctic Monkeys, towing a sound system on a trailer to play the songs! Expect to hear Colesâ€™ Corner, and turn the volume up to 11, nicely timed to coincide with Tramlines Festival.
