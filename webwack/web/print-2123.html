		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Open Rights Group Sheffield offers a session where you can bring your laptops, phones and other devices. They will help you to install and understand tools you can use to maintain your privacy online. Come and learn about:

• TAILS – The live operating system for preserving privacy and anonymity
• GPG – Securing your email communications
• Privacy tools for Android and iPhone smart phones

If you have seen the CITIZENFOUR documentary then you might recognise Tails as one of the tools that Edward Snowden and journalists Laura Poitras and Glen Glenwald used to secure their communications when they were preparing to publish the revelations about UK and US government surveillance. 

The event is free to attend and everyone is welcome. There is a limited capacity at the venue so please make sure to RSVP per person. Open Rights Group uses meetup to promote campaigns and local events, but if you would rather not use meetup, please send an email to say you are coming.
