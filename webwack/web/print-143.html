		<td>Boris Johnson will be in Rotherham on 13th September to deliver a speech to business people at a Northern Powerhouse conference to be held at the Magna centre. Join this protest called by Rotherham Stand Up To Racism supported by Rotherham TUC.

Boris Johnson with his dog whistle politics seeks to legitimise racism - particularly Islamophobia. He has previously stated that Islam has left Muslim countries “literally centuries behind” the West. His government will be nasty, racist and right wing. His cabinet is full of vicious Tories who have track records of attacking ordinary people, and want to end free ­movement on 1 November, the day after a no-deal Brexit would go through. This would make the hostile environment even worse for migrants.

With the recent growth of violent far right movements, it’s dangerous that mainstream politicians are fanning the flames of divisive scapegoating. We face increasingly normalised racism being spewed from the top of the establishment. Like Trump in the White House, now we have a Prime Minister who will give airtime to racist views.

Come and stand in solidarity with all those who find themselves targets of Trump and Johnson’s racism, and stress the need for every instance of racism, Islamophobia and antisemitism to be challenged.
