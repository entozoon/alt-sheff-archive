XR INTERNATIONAL REBELLION CALL-OUT

Sept 2019 - preparations for October

Extinction Rebellion has issued a call-out, in the final two weeks before the international rebellion: Volunteers are needed to help make it a success. There are many roles to fill. Every little bit of help is appreciated! Help spread the work around so nobody is overburdened. If you can join the rebellion in London, even for a single day, you can fill in Sheffield XR form (<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNn9CgSmqdMyLemx2rRYMIhI4FYO-nqU26HR0W3gC4wd3tJw/viewform?link_id=8&amp;can_id=682a14dd18c745347e8212acc3d7b2b6&amp;source=email-actions-manchester-then-sheffield-then-london&amp;email_referrer=email_606235&amp;email_subject=actions-manchester-then-sheffield-then-london">Googledoc</a>) to let them know.

<strong>	Food / kitchen - volunteers to help “Feed The North”</strong> in the London Rebellion (5/6/7th through to 21st October). XR Sheffield are going to run a 24hr kitchen making 3 hot meals a day and supporting the rebels through the night, and need people to fill a variety of roles!
<strong>    Preparing for London</strong> (sourcing equipment, planning kitchen set up, recruiting volunteers and planning recipes)
<strong>    Equipment donations</strong> please look at the wish-list for equipment and resources needed for the London kitchen
<strong>    On the ground staff in London</strong> the 24hr kitchen will need chefs, servers, dishwashers and couriers, also lots of people with health and safety training (can be done online).
<strong>    Food procurement </strong>if you have access to/contact with a food procurement business and you think they might give us some waste food/donations please get in touch.
<strong>    Setting up our kitchen and the site for the north </strong>on the weekend of the 5th of October: building/heavy lifting/putting up gazebos.
If you can help, please contact Eve: <a href=%e2%80%9dmailto_xrnorthfood%40gmail.html>xrnorthfood@gmail.com</a> 07402 673579
<strong> Programming</strong> XR are reaching out to ask for help with creating a vibrant and exciting programme for the main stage at the Northern Site, looking for:
    Speakers
    Bands, musicians, singers
    Comedians
    Theatre groups
    Stage managers (to manage transitions between acts, equipment, performers being in the right place at the right time)
    Stage coordinators (to liaise between the stage, police liaison team and the rest of the site)
    Programmers (to be planning for the following day and ensuring schedules are full)
    Hosts (to introduce each act, XR messaging/announcements on stage about actions, police issues, etc)

Speakers and performers should reflect the diversity of the North, they particularly encourage contributions from women, people with disabilities and BME, LGBT+ and working class communities.
If you would like to be part of this, or know someone who would, please get in touch with details of what you/your contact can offer and the dates (between 7 and 21 October) you/they can make it to London. Contact Laura: <a href=%e2%80%9dmailto_lauramcq%40hotmail.co.html>lauramcq@hotmail.co.uk</a> 07708 163601 or Sophie: <a href=%e2%80%9dmailto_sophiearmour1%40gmail.html>sophiearmour1@gmail.com</a> 07875 131520.

<strong>Creative call-out </strong>to ALL Northern rebels who will be joining in London for the October Rebellion! The overall theme of the Northern site will be ’Northern Forest,’ and for this the plan is to re-wild a patch of London with three main concept-pieces: The Beehive, The Forest and The Nest.
What would the wild be without its wildlife? The two costume themes will be ‘The Birds and the Bees’ and ‘Northern Forest’ Let us flex our creative Northern muscles and get as many of our rebels striped, spotted, feathered and furred as possible. Additionally any props, banners, decorations, placards and artwork that you can beg, borrow, steal, or rustle up to fit with this theme will help to make our forest a thriving hub of biodiversity, with the potential to put a smile on the face of even the most sour-faced dawn commuter.
If you don’t want to design your own costume, please contact  (xrworldsnorth@gmail.com) for one of the 7 giant origami animal-heads (available as pdf downloads to print at home - badgers, foxes, wolves, bears and more. If you would like to arrange local workshops or get togethers to make lots, that would be even better! They may take a bit of time to assemble, but the final result will be well worth it.

<strong>Police Liaison</strong>
XR Sheffield need to organise a rota of people to cover the entire 2 weeks on a shift basis. No previous experience necessary, but there is some training available in Manchester weekend 29th Sept but is not mandatory as we can pass on briefing details to them.
If you can help, please contact Jo Murphey via Basecamp, text 07986 949250, Signal, or email <a href=%e2%80%9dmailto_info%40jomurphypilates.co.html>info@jomurphypilates.co.uk</a>.

<strong> Get yourself sorted for Rebellion</strong>
    Buy coach tickets to London. For rebels with disabilities there are subsidised rail transport.
    All Affinity groups, please appoint a Sustenance Rep responsible for thinking about food, what equipment you need to take, and food supplies you can collect for our donation tables (vegan preferred).
    Join an affinity group for going to London to take direct action.

<strong>Come meet Extinction Rebellion Sheffield</strong> for food and conversation at weekly meetings on Mondays (23rd & 30th September), 6pm at Union St. cafe.
