Job-seekers claiming Job Seeker&#39;s Allowance are required to use the Government&#39;s online recruitment search site &#39;Universal Jobmatch&#39;. This is more than just a website; it&#39;s a tool that Job Centre advisors can use to monitor job hunting and enforce sanctions. It monitors job searches made, time spent on the site, jobs applied for and those turned down. There are data insecurities associated with the site, enabling a situation where 50% of ads are fraudulent, and bogus employers are accessing private data. Unlike other recruitment services or search engines, job seekers don&#39;t always have a choice to pick a better service.

The meeting will be discussing more about what Universal Jobmatch is and how this system of surveillance is having a real effect on people&#39;s lives. 

A talk by Guest speaker Ruth Coustick-Deal, Supporter Officer for the Open Rights Group, which is for anyone interested in digital rights: copyright, freedom of expression, censorship, parody, privacy, open data, free software. You don&#39;t have to be a member to come to the meet-ups.
