		<td>An all-women&#39; s meeting, marking International Women&#39; s Day. Now, after over 60 years of colonisation and ethnic cleansing, Palestinians are still strong in their sense of identity as a people, in their determination to achieve justice and in their solidarity with each other and with people across the world who support them. And Palestinian women are still holding the human enterprise of survival together, as well as seeking to play their full part in the political struggle on every level. Support groups from the North of England acknowledge and celebrate the role of Palestinian women, whose testimony and example are so potent and inspirational.
