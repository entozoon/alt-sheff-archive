		<td>WDM aims to change the actions, policies and institutions of governments, corporations and wealthy minorities, which are preventing an end to poverty and injustice. Part of a global movement, it works alongside people protesting in the developing world. The organising meeting of WDM is held on the first Thursday of each month, to discuss coming events and campaigns. It is usually followed by informal gathering in the nearby <i>Church House</i> pub.
