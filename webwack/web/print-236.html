		<td>Come and hear about the experience of visiting the West Bank last November. A Sheffield Labour Friends of Palestine talk with information about what their delegation did, and impressions from what was seen and heard. Also information about future visits for those who might be interested in going.  

In the visit to the West Bank the SLFP delegation were shown "facts on the ground" such as settler-only roads. The visit also included visits to East Jerusalem, the Jordan Valley, Ramallah, Nablus, Tubas, Bethlehem and the Beit Jala and Cremisan Valley.  It included meetings with many groups struggling for justice in Palestine including the UN Office for Co-ordinating Humanitarian Affairs, representatives from Fatah, the Military Court Watch on children in prison, the Free Marwan Barghouthi and all Political Prisoners Campaign, the non-violence resistance committee in the village of Nabi Saleh, a visit to projects in the Al Askar Refugee Camp, and to various schools in Nablus and Tubas. In Bethlehem they visited Aida Refugee camp, and visited the Beit Jala and Cremisan Valley with a representative of the PLO Negotiation Affairs Department.

Please take time to <a href="http://www.sheffieldpsc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/FreeHafez.pdf">read about Hafez Omar</a>, a Palestinian political poster artist. He was arrested at home in Ramallah on 13th March, and taken by force to an Israeli prison by the military.</td>
