		<td>South Yorkshire People&#39;s Assembly started last summer, as a popular opposition to the cuts and cruel policies of the current elitist government. It has a bank account and a steering group has spent time organising local meetings and activities. It is now time to consider the way forward, especially as A full National Meeting will take place in March in London, of the National People&#39;s Assembly against Austerity.  

The main AGM agenda items will be to agree on a new constitution and to elect an Organising Committee.
