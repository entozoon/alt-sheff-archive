		<td>Extinction Rebellion’s Main Monday Meetings (MMM) will take place on Zoom, an online video conferencing platform that can be accessed via your phone or computer. If you haven’t used this before here is a handy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFhAEoCF7jg">Youtube video</a> showing how to join and a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WVhQ5YE9Qu4eJBLDuTXJOxYTvNr-XUB94wwvc5J2tzY/">Guide to using Zoom</a> from XR.

Here is the Zoom link to click at the time you would like to join the meeting: <a href="https://zoom.us/j/113741152">https://zoom.us/j/113741152</a>

It may take time to get everyone used to a meeting of this size, so it will start early, from 6.20pm, to sort technical issues, chat with the facilitators and have a general catch up with other rebels. The main meeting will start as usual at 6.45pm.

If you are struggling, the <a href="mailto:xrsheffield@gmail.com">XR Sheffield email inbox</a> will be monitored and you can access one-to-one support by contacting 07872 489683 or 07474 373673.

<strong>How it will work:</strong>
    During the main part of the meeting, they will be muting all members other than those actively presenting to the group.
    The chat function can be used to bring things to the attention of the facilitator.
    Hand signals can still be used to interact, just like real life meetings, and the facilitators will be watching out for this.
Please be patient, meeting online is a new experience for all!
