		<td>Seeds are one of humanity&#39;s greatest resources. We rely on seeds for most of our food and much of our clothing and medicine. It&#39;s more important now than ever that we maintain our food sovereignty. One seed can produce a plant that can produce thousands of seeds. Saving seeds yourself is an important and rewarding aspect of local food growing. 

This is Sheffield&#39;s annual seed swap, held at Heeley City Farm Community Classroom, by the duck pond. Pack up your home grown seeds and come along to swap them with like-minded growing enthusiasts. It&#39;s always very busy. There will be a large collection of flower, fruit and vegetable seeds; there should also be heritage seed varieties available, along with tips and information about other local organic growing projects. 

Free, but please bring some donations of seeds to help the event along if you can, or a small cash donation in the collecting tins would be really appreciated. Heeley City Farm is 20 mins walk from Sheffield, or catch the No. 47 bus to Herdings from town - it drops you right outside the Farm. For more information please contact Darrell Maryon, tel: 07768 932613, email: <a href="mailto:darrell@heeleyfarm.org.uk">darrell@heeleyfarm.org.uk</a> or call Sarah at the Farm on Sheff 2505113
