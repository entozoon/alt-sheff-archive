		<td>40 years ago a military coup plunged Chile into a brutal right-wing dictatorship, the first country in the world to experience the shock of "neoliberalism". Many fled the country, some arriving here to make Sheffield their new home. Now, in commemoration of the anniversary, there is a series of events including this festival of films at the Showroom. Further events are listed separately and on the websites below.
