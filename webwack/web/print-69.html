		<td>South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG) is part of a network of groups and people in Sheffield which have worked together successfully for asylum rights since 2007. This is the first meeting of 2020 and all are welcome to attend and help make plans for this year’s activities.

<strong>Plans already include a Sheffield demonstration on January 18th alongside the local Eritrean community to highlight the desperate situation of refugees in Libya. 
</strong>
SYMAAG will continue to promote the Justice for Simba campaign after a successful Sheffield launch meeting in November, reported by Channel 4 News. <strong>Simba was charged £100,000 for life-saving NHS treatment despite living in the UK for most of his life. He wants to campaign not just for himself but for other people who face the realities of the UK’s hostile environment policy.</strong>

Newcomers are welcome to these meetings. Come with your ideas, skills and enthusiasm to help make campaigns win.
