		<td>40 years ago a military coup plunged Chile into a brutal right-wing dictatorship, the first country in the world to experience the shock of "neoliberalism". Many fled the country, some arriving here to make Sheffield their new home. 

Now, in commemoration of the anniversary, there is a series of events including this vigil with The Socialist Choir, and Jeshu dancing ‘Cueca Sola’, (National Chilean dance- for the ‘Disappeared’). All welcome.

(The same evening, a documentary filmshow Nostalgia for the Light and a meal will be held at Santiago Restaurant, Chesterfield from 7pm.)
