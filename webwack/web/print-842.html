		<td>‘The science delusion’ is the belief that science already understands the nature of reality, in principle. The fundamental questions are answered, leaving only the details to be filled in. The impressive achievements of science seemed to support this confident attitude. But recent research has revealed unexpected problems at the heart of physics, cosmology, biology, medicine and psychology. Rupert Sheldrake argues that the sciences are being constricted by assumptions that have hardened into dogmas.
