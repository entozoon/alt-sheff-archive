		<td>DanesHill, near Retford (south of Sheffield) has recently had a Protection Camp to protest at fracking tests. David Burley of Frack Free South Yorkshire will be speaking in Sheffield at this public meeting.

‘After weeks of delays and disruption the Dart Energy rig finally leaves Daneshill: The past weeks have seen a persistent and committed group of protectors and local people protesting at the gates of the Dart Energy Coal Bed Methane exploration site at Daneshill. The site and Dart operated 24 hours a day, and so have the protectors. Morning noon and night trucks have been blocked from entering and leaving the site, racking up many hours of delays and frustrating Dart’s operation. The Daneshill cast runs to hundreds. From those that came and stayed for weeks to those that came, brought food and stayed for a few hours.’
