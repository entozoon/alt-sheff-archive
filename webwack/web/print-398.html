		<td>A talk by Chardine Taylor Stone, award winning cultural producer, writer and feminist activist. Her work is inspired by her experiences as a Black British working class woman having found her voice through alternative subcultures like Punk and Rockabilly. She was featured in The Voice newspaper as one of the Women Who Rocked the World in 2015, Diva Magazine’s LGBT Power List 2016 and Buzzfeed’s ‘The Most Inspiring British LGBT People Of 2016‘. In May 2017 Chardine won the British LGBT Award for ‘Outstanding Contribution to LGBT+ life’.

Chardine is also the founder of Black Girl’s Picnic, a movement in collective self care for Black women and girls, and Stop Rainbow Racism which works to stop racist performances in LGBTQ venues. As a writer, educator and commentator Chardine uses music, art and fashion history to instigate socio-political analysis. She often lectures and facilitates workshops on topics such as Black/Working Class feminism, Black Queer identities, Afrofuturism, music subculture histories and Black involvement in the esoteric, weird and downright bizarre! She is regularly asked to speak and consult on these topics for the media as well as film/culture festivals, conferences and art institutions such as the BFI, Tate Modern, ICA and British Library. She also bangs the drums in Black feminist punk band Big Joanie. Chardine is also a board member for the Museum of Homelessness and Duckie Youth.

Whilst Bloc Projects works hard to maintain a Public Programme that is free for everyone, they ask you to kindly consider bringing something along to donate food and basic toiletries for S2 Foodbank. For a full list of much needed items please see <a href="https://www.s2foodbank.org.uk/">www.s2foodbank.org.uk</a>.
