		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A free interactive lecture on how planners use social science to help them understand the homes we want in years to come. Society and population are always changing, and so too are the demands and expectations of housing. In parts of the UK, including in Sheffield and Rotherham, there is a shortage of good quality, affordable homes. 

Led by Professor Ed Ferrari, Director of the Centre for Regional Economic and Social Research (CRESR) at Sheffield Hallam University. Part of Understanding Society, the festival of social sciences, organised by the universities (Sheffield and Hallam), funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. Free to attend, pre-booking a place is recommended.
