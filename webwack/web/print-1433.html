		<td>A feminist arts event to celebrate International Women´s Day. Verse Matters provides a platform for poetry, storytelling, puppetry, music and comedy, showcasing the work of talented people in a friendly, supportive environment. Some performers tell stories that have been erased by society: refugees, detainees, prisoners. Others will be speaking in public for the first time. Others are experienced poets, dramatists and performers. All are respected and appreciated.
