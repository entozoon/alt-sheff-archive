		<td>Everything you need to know about US economic sanctions against Cuba: their origins, their provisions, how they contravene international law, and how they affect the lives of Cubans.

Salim Lamrani, who teaches at the University of Paris-Sorbonne Paris IV and the University of la Réunion, will examine the US government’s own official documents to expose what is hiding in plain sight: an indefensible, vicious, and wasteful blockade that has been roundly condemned by citizens around the world. He will also be signing copies of his new book.</td>
