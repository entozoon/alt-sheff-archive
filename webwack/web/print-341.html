		<td>An inspiring documentary film about local food roots and discussion. From the first pioneering organic box schemes in the early 1990s to feeding cities through the UK local food movement, and what this might mean for the future. Regather Director Gareth Roberts will host a discussion on the topic of ‘Value & Values’ in the food system. In academic and policy research circles the Regather Box fruit and veg box scheme is recognised as a successful example of a ‘Values Based Food Chain’ (VBFC) which embodies local, co-operative and organic values within a local food system. 

Tickets £5 from the link below.
