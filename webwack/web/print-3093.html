		<td>The 2013 Sheffield Anarchist Book Fair is a free two-day event organised by local activists and volunteers, part of a worldwide movement celebrating the political philosophy of anarchism. 

The book fair brings together over 50 radical booksellers, distributors, independent presses, and political groups from around the country, and features books, pamphlets, zines, art, crafts and films. Also speakers, panels, and political lectures as well as a cinema, all in the Showroom Workstation.

This is followed by an evening social. 

The second day activities (Sunday 12th) will be outdoors, including a radical walking tour around the city and an open game of three-sided football.

If you would like to get involved with the organising of the event you can contact the co-ordinating collective at sheffield(at)bookfair.org.uk
