		<td>As 2019 ended with disappointments we would rather forget, and catastrophic extreme climate events around the world, we’ve had time now to rest and gather our energy, and what better way to raise our spirits than to spring into action with a big clean-up of one of the dirtiest locations in the city centre?

 Extinction Rebellion Sheffield invite all to join in for this surprise early Spring Cleaning action! There will be plenty of cleaning to do, so you <i>could</i> come wearing overalls, pinnies, rubber gloves etc., with cleaning sponges, brushes, mops and buckets, squeegees, feather dusters etc, or maybe dressed smartly for town, or even just in your normal Friday morning clothes, ready to leaflet and talk to passers by. 

<strong>Come to the full briefing at 18-20 Union St. S1 2JP at 11am, when all will be revealed.</strong>

(Drop-in XR Coffee and Chat Sessions at the Blue Moon Cafe continue on Wednesdays 4-5.30pm, and Monday Meetings at Union Street, 6pm. Everyone welcome.)
