Come to a gig to support two local groups - Assist Sheffield and CADOS (the Campaign against the deportation of Odette Sefuko). Jellybean Jazz are a 5 piece band who play jazz inspired music that you will know and love, and want to get up and dance to! Think Nina Simone, Cole Porter, Miles Davis... classic songs with the jellybean twist for added heart and soul. 

Entrance is free but you will be able to donate to Assist and CADOS.
