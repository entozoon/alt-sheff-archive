		<td>&#39;Zari&#39; is Zarghuna Kargar - the Afghan founder of the ground-breaking BBC World Service Afghan Women&#39;s Hour. Profoundly influential, it broadcasts discussion, stories and advice covering issues faced by women in Afghanistan every day, and Dear Zari was the most popular strand in the programme.

From the young girl forced to grow up as a boy, a childhood spent in the dark weaving carpets, the widows shunned by society, to the uplifting story of a family of kite-makers, Dear Zari, a collection of remarkable and heart-rending true stories, invites us to better understand the women of Afghanistan. Zarghuna Kargar also shares her story, growing up as a refugee in Pakistan, beginning a new life in the West and struggling with her own arranged marriage.


Tickets £7.50/£5.50 concessions.

Part of <b>Off the Shelf</b>, Sheffield&#39;s 21-year old annual festival of words, with a great programme of over 200 events this year.
