		<td>An event hosted by Sheffield Socialist Forums, with Jill Mountford on Women in Solidarnosc, and Demaine Boocock on women’s struggles in China.

States run on the oppressive Stalinist model have claimed to defend women’s rights. However, in the USSR abortion was illegal from 1936 to 1955 and the state strongly encouraged the role of motherhood for women. The Chinese state has attempted to control women’s bodies through the one child policy, and recent drives encouraging women to have more children. The events in Poland 1980 that led to the collapse of Stalinism in the Eastern Bloc in 1989 will also be discussed. Polish women workers made a contribution to these events yet their story is often downplayed. 

Against the authoritarian Stalinist systems women have been at the forefront of the struggles. More details on the page below.
