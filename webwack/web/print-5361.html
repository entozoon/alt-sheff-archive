		<td>Public meeting to discuss progress in reclaiming the Earth Centre. This former environmental 'attraction' has been shamefully left abandoned by Doncaster Council. The first meeting in December was attended by a really diverse mix from the whole South Yorkshire community all whom shared the same concern and will to do something about it.

There are also continuing gatherings every Sunday at 1pm at the Earth Centre for positive community actions - all are welcome.
