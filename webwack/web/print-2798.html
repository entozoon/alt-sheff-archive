Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. The events are free though they ask for a Â£3 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
