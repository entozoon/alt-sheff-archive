		<td>One Sheffield Many Cultures presentation, with Prof. Danny Dorling. Recently released government documents have revealed that following the Toxteth riots in 1981, Margaret Thatcher&#39;s Chancellor Geoffrey Howe argued for the &#39;managed decline&#39; of Liverpool. &#39;We must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill,&#39; he said.

In this timely meeting, Danny Dorling will explain the differences between the recent decades of social change in Yorkshire and parts of the North West where there has been far less immigration. At a time when immigration, immigrants and their descendants are under constant attack, it is important to understand that these social changes indicate a healthy, dynamic economy - and that the places with little or no immigration are the ones facing stagnation and poverty.
