A family-friendly celebration of life where power is sourced renewably by wind, solar and human-power (on bikes). Practical engagement and active participation are the themes. Come and be part of the fun and a positive force of change.

Run by a group of volunteers with over 20 years experience, Northern Green Gathering has played an important role in stimulating eco-awareness. It brings people together to educate, celebrate and debate a wide range of environmental issues. Childrenâ€™s area and parades, artwork, workshops for crafts, sustainable living, music, campaigns, a healing area, sauna, organic food cafes and a communal bonfire.

Bring your tent or camper van to stay in the beautiful Derbyshire Dales, at a cost little more than the average campsite.
