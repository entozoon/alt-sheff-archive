		<td>Pumpkin Carving! Ghostly Lantern Making! Spooky Crafts! Carve out some gruesome faces for Halloween, make a ghostly lantern or take part in other spooky Halloween themed crafts. You can even bring your lanterns on the family walk later on.

Wear old clothes because this is messy fun! Children under 8 must be supervised at all times and parents/carers must stay with their children if they are taking part in the pumpkin carving as they will need help with the carving tools.

 Heeley City Farm is 20 mins walk from Sheffield, or catch the No 47 bus to Herdings from town - it drops you right outside the Farm. Event held in the Community Room by the Duck Pond. Entrance to the Farm is free and so are some of the crafts but the Pumpkin Carving has a small charge to raise money for the animals and projects in the local community. Ring Sheff 2580482 option 5 or email <a href="mailto:s.hardy@heeleyfarm.org.uk">s.hardy@heeleyfarm.org.uk</a> for more info.
