		<td>Sheffield Equality Group&#39;s Inspiring Cinema season starts with a showing of Ken Loach&#39;s "Spirit of &#39;45". As the welfare state is being dismantled, Loach argues that "we should look to the past for a better future". Looking at the spirit of unity that enabled the formation of the welfare state, the film is more relevant than ever 70 years on.
