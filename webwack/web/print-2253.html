		<td>Have a rummage for a bargain and help to raise some money for Heeley City Farm. Women&#39;s, men&#39;s and kids clothes, bric-a-brac, books, toys and household items. Any donations of good quality items are also most appreciated. Help to raise money to keep the Farm open - funding is tight and without your support they cannot continue to offer the services they do to Heeley and the rest of Sheffield. You can make a difference and help the Farm to keep helping adults with learning difficulties and disabilities, young people and school children, those in food and fuel poverty, families, the unemployed, those with mental health problems and older members of the community.

 Jumble Sale held in Ann&#39;s Road Community Centre across the road from the Farm, next to the school carpark, as this has more space. Ring Sheff 2590482 option 6 for more information or email <a href="mailto:s.hardy@heeleyfarm.org.uk">s.hardy@heeleyfarm.org.uk</a>. Heeley City Farm is 20 mins walk from Sheffield, or catch the No 47 bus to Herdings from town - it drops you right outside the Farm. 50p admission
