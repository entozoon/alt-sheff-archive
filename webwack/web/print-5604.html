		<td>Women are welcome to join this vigil protesting against the development of a new nuclear weapons system to replace the current Trident nuclear submarines.

This system will cost Â£76 billion over its lifetime. Nuclear weapons do not address our military security needs. They certainly cannot provide security from climate change, soaring food prices and unemployment which are major challenges facing us iminently. With the UK facing its biggest economic crisis for decades there is a stronger case than ever to put the money earmarked for nuclear weapons to better use.

Everyone is welcome to sign our petition & letter to their MP calling for this issue to be debated in Parliament.</td>
