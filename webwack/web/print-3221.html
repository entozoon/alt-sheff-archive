		<td>Ki Himayat is an exciting evening of cultural entertainment, by a group of Sheffield Hallam students. All proceeds will go towards Bluebell Wood Hospice’s funds for a new P-Pod chair.

A variety of acts including headline act international artist, Indian classical violinist and Ghazal Singer Kamalbir Singh Nandra. There will also be a raffle with great prizes available! You can buy raffle tickets before and during the event from any of the event organisers. 

Bluebell Wood Children’s Hospice offers care and support to children with a shortened life expectancy, both in their own homes and at their hospice in North Anston. Bluebell Wood is a place filled with laughter and love and gives families the chance to relax, take a break, have fun and support the whole family.

It costs £3 million every year to offer this support and Bluebell Wood receives no statutory government funding. Without the help from supporters they simply could not help all the children that they do. Show support towards this fantastic event!
 
Tickets £5 adults, £3 children (under 10 years) from the event managers or online at: <a href="http://www.kihimayat.eventbrite.co.uk/">www.kihimayat.eventbrite.co.uk</a></td>
