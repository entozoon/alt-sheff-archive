		<td>Outside the Law: Stories from Guantánamo is new documentary telling the story of Guantánamo: torture, extraordinary rendition and secret prisons. Examining how the Bush administration turned its back on domestic and international law, rounding up prisoners in Afghanistan and Pakistan without adequate screening and often for large bounty payments.  Focusing on the stories of three prisoners, Shaker Aamer, Binyam Mohamed and Omar Deghayes, 'Outside the Law: Stories from Guantánamo' is  powerful rebuke to the myth that Guantánamo holds “the worst of the worst”.

(Spectacle Productions, 2009; 75 mins., directed by Polly Nash and Andy Worthington)

Omar Deghayes (Guantanamo 'Detainee') and Poly Nash (Director) will be present to introduce the film.
