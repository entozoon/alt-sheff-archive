		<td>At 11am on Saturday 28th February, thousands of 38 Degrees members are coming together in town centres across England to stand up for our NHS. This government has pushed our NHS to breaking point: selling parts off to private companies and cutting funding in important areas. NHS doctors and experts over the last few weeks have made one thing clear: if we want an NHS after May’s general election, we need to be campaigning now. Together, we can run a huge campaign over the next two months - with a simple message to MP candidates everywhere: ‘Save our NHS’. 38 Degrees members are meeting on high streets to gather thousands of signatures on local ‘Save our NHS’ petitions. To remind people that our NHS is a precious, life-saving service - and ask them to join in saying no to cuts and privatisation. And to make sure every politician in every constituency knows that if they intend to run down or sell off our health service, they've got a fight on their hands.

If you can, come along and help gather signatures for your local ‘Save our NHS' petition.
