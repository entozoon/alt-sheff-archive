		<td>Would you like to see more green energy in Sheffield? Then take the opportunity to invest in Sheffield Renewables! Make an ethical and local investment with Sheffield Renewables and play a part in the citys first community renewable energy scheme, Jordan Dam Hydro.

Sheffield Renewables are holding a series of informal talks aimed at giving potential investors and those just interested in hearing about what they are doing more information about Sheffield Renewables, the Jordan Dam project and the Share Offer. It would be an ideal opportunity for anyone who was not able to attend the Share Offer Launch to come along and listen to a talk on the Share Offer and have a chat with some investors and volunteers. There will also be tea, coffee and biscuits provided! The talks will take place on:

8pm-9pm, Thursday 1st November, The Crowded House, 215 Sharrow Vale Road, Sheffield, S11 8ZB

8pm, Monday 12th November, St Thomas Church, Nairn Street, Crookes, S10 1UL. Please note that this will take place in the upper games hall which is accessed by stairs as the lift currently isnâ€™t working due to building work

For more information, please contact Emma at <a href="mailto:emma@sheffieldrenewables.org.uk">emma@sheffieldrenewables.org.uk</a> or on Sheff 2508367.
