		<td>This meeting (Room 2 - first floor) will focus on making the display for the April 20th meeting. Bring anything that might make an exhibition space look welcoming/interesting/exciting! There won't be a scheduled agenda apart from that, but will probably be plenty of chat around the issues of equality. If you can help out on April 20th then please get in touch - extra hands always welcome.
