		<td>Join Phil on the annual early morning bird walk and see which of our feathered friends are making their home on the Farm and the surrounding woodland and riverside areas in Heeley this year.

The diverse terrains on the Farm means there will be plenty of different birds to see. Phil will be identifying and giving people advice on how to identify the common birds found on the farm including the just arrived summer migrants such as Blackcaps, Willow Warblers and Chiffchaffs as well as our resident and ever loved Robins, Dunnocks, Blackbirds and many others.

The small 5 acre site has attracted over 90 species over the years and there is always something interesting to see weather it be a rarity or just a great encounter with one of our common species. In the past years species such as Wood Warbler, Black Redstart and Lesser Spotted Woodpecker have been recorded in May and the nature of the site means that anything could turn up.

Some parts of the walk are not accessible to prams or wheelchairs but alternative paths available - it may mean missing out on certain sections.

Meet outside the Farm Kitchen.
