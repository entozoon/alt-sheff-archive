		<td>1974; during a violent miners strike in a quiet village a teenage artist falls in love with the gorgeous new girl but their attempts to escape cause him to betray his family, community and best friends and he is forced to choose between his old friends and his new love. With community bonds straining under a crumbling economy the 1970s setting is very relevant for today. Made in the former coalmining areas of Northumberland with universal themes of friendship, first loves and teenage rebellion. An uplifting and soulful mix of cool 1970s styles, warm-hearted romance and gritty social realism.
