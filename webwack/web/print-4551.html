		<td>Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening with talks on a wide range of topics. This month Rory Sutherland will be speaking on the subject of Karl Popper's distinction between mechanistic systems and unknowable, complex ones. And how small interventions can produce fabulous effects.

Rory read Classics at Christ's College, Cambridge, and has worked for Amex, BT, Compaq, Microsoft, IBM, BUPA, easyJet, and Unilever. Whew!!
