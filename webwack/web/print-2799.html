		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Dr. Katie Edwards presents a remarkable book, ’Admen and Eve: The Bible in Contemporary Advertising’, an analysis of the phenomenon of the use of the Bible and the figure of Eve in advertising. She explores how the use of Eve by brands such as Christian Dior, DKNY, Ford Streetka and Agent Provocateur shows how Eve has become the ultimate postfeminist icon of female sexual and consumer power. Eve in advertising is a revealing example of how the Bible functions today. 

Dr Katie Edwards is a lecturer in the Bible and Contemporary Culture and Society in the Department of Biblical Studies at the University of Sheffield. She researches the impact and influence of the Bible on the modern world and in popular culture. 

In collaboration with Showroom Cinema, and in association with the University of Sheffield. Tickets £7.50/£5.50 concessions.
