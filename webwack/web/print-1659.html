		<td>A public lecture by Professor Anat Admati, of Stanford University, hosted by Sheffield Institute for Corporate and Commercial Law (SICCL). Professor Admati is one of the world's foremost financial economists and a global authority on bank regulation. She was recently named as "one of the Top 100 most influential people" by Time Magazine. Her bestselling book, "The Bankers' New Clothes: What's Wrong with Banking and What to Do About It" (co-authored with Professor Martin Hellwig) was described by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times as "the most important book to emerge from the crisis".

Her lecture will explain how post-crisis reforms to bank regulation have not been sufficient to prevent future crises and how the banking system remains dangerously fragile. The lecture will be followed by a Q&A (question and answer session).
