		<td>Sheffield Friends of the Earth is showing 4 green films, as voted by the public, on Wednesday 1st, 8th, 15th and 22nd February. The Co-operative has kindly provided financial sponsorship of all the films.

Queen of the Sun takes us on a journey through the catastrophic disappearance of bees and the mysterious world of the beehive, weaving an unusual and dramatic story of the heartfelt struggles of beekeepers, scientists and philosophers from around the world. Together they reveal both the problems and the solutions in renewing a culture in balance with nature.

A speaker from the Sheffield Beekeepers&#39; Association will be present to answer any questions regarding the film.

Tea, coffee and other refreshments will be available for a small fee. The film festival is free but donations are welcome.
