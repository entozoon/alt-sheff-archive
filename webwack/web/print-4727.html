		<td>All welcome to this monthly meeting where the main topic for discussion will be the progress of the campaign to scrap renewal of the Trident nuclear weapons system, particularly given the varying opinions within the coalition government as to what to do about it and its enormous cost, and the alternatives for deployment of workforces that would otherwise be redundant.

Sheffield CND meets on the third Wednesday of each month, except August.
