		<td>Meet before 10am at Cathedral Precinct with your bike to get the tram to near Halfway and then ride the short distance to Rother Valley  - and beyond! (There is a tram service back at 3pm as well!) Sheffield holds the current world record for most bikes on a tram. This is a special event, trams don't usually take bikes, thanks Supertram :(

There are various rides when the party arrives: CTC adult and family rides, a women-only ride, as well as a Cycle Sheffield ride. You can join the one that suits you, even choose when you get to the start - or you can just take the tram, take off and either return by tram or otherwise, just to show Supertram that cycles on trams is a popular idea.

Please being a picnic and drink, although these can also be bought at Rother Valley and at Pools Brook, and look forward to a fun day out. Remember the clocks go back this morning! It would be good to know how many are coming along. Details from <a href="mailto:polytone@doctors.org.uk">polytone@doctors.org.uk</a>
