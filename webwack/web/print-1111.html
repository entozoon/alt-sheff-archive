		<th>Details</th>
		<td>On the 19th July, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Refugees launched a new Inquiry into the experiences of new refugees in the UK. This is a brilliant opportunity for refugees and people working with them to tell people in power about the challenges faced by refugees in the UK, as well as showcasing areas of innovation and good practice. The inquiry is particularly interested in hearing about integration, employment and access (and barriers) to key services. They’re also keen to investigate the differences in support available for resettled refugees and those who go through the asylum system, and whether there are particular barriers faced by different groups of refugees, such as women or LGBTI refugees.
