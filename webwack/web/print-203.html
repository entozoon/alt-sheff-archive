		<td>People are being taken from our communities and locked up in prison-like detention centres, without time limit, with no idea of when they might be released. Why? They just don’t (yet) have the correct immigration papers...

“These Walls Must Fall” is an initiative started by Right to Remain, building a network of locally-based community campaigns, part of the growing movement to end immigration detention. People are pushing the campaign through their community groups, voluntary organisations, charities, trade unions, activist groups, faith communities, student societies, sports clubs, etc. This follows an earlier listed event on 17th June.

This workshop will introduce the campaign, and discuss how it can be built in Sheffield and the surrounding areas.

To register, please email the name of the person who wants to attend to <a href=mailto:contact@detention.org.uk>contact@detention.org.uk</a>, along with any accessibility needs, which they will do their best to accommodate.</td>
