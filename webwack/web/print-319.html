		<td>Green Dayâ€™s rock musical American Idiot, in Sheffield during the 15th anniversary year since the original album came out. It is the story of "three boyhood friends, each searching for meaning in a post 9/11 world" with Green Day music and lyrics. Contains strong language and drug references, and presumably a bit of politics.
