		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Sheffield railway station footbridge should remain open because it was built with public money, to be part of an integrated transport, bike and pedestrian network. RASC has has campaigned for 4 years against closure, and is unimpressed with the recent hurried, time-limited offer by the Secretary of State for a second bridge north of the station.

To discuss these issues, everyone is welcome at this meeting.
