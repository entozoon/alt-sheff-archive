		<td>Various local councils have declared a <a href="https://climateemergency.uk/">Climate Emergency</a>, but not Sheffield City Council. Extinction Rebellion are putting  pressure on to make sure they take it seriously, by attending the Full Council meeting, (starts 2pm, agenda online <a href="http://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?MId=7007">here</a>).

It seems this idea is taking off; Labour Councillors are asking for a review of the current zero-carbon date (2050) and the Green Party want it to be 2030, plus a renewable electricity contract, so it could be a useful debate. If you can make it, please join in.
