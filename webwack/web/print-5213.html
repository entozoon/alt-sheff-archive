		<td>Meet at the Cathedral tram stop before 10am for a tram-assisted ride out of Sheffield to Waterthorpe at £5 return for bike plus rider, £10 for tandem and riders, £2 for child with own bike. (NB This is a specially commissioned tram, not for public use, so if you miss it sorry there isn't another one you can board!) Cycle through the housing estate on off-road cycle track to Rother Valley Country Park (where you can join in if you live at that side of town). Toilets and cafe for a picnic if you've not food. Then separate to either easy, intermediate or longer routes. A ride to suit all preferences.

Return about 3.45pm to town centre. Come on, help fill the tram and beat the record of 34 bikes and riders last year.
