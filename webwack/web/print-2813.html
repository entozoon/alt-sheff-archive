		<td>Installing underfloor insulation:  Andy Walker of SURE Insulation leads a one-day workshop.

You’ll be working on an underfloor insulation project, in a real cellar in the Meersbrook area. With around eight people there’ll be plenty of opportunity to practice all steps in the installation process. There’ll be lots of practical tips and hints about how to improve the thermal comfort of your home without it costing the earth. After the session you should be confident and have the knowledge to tackle a similar home improvement project yourself.

Event run by Green Triangle <a href="http://greentriangle.wetpaint.com/">greentriangle.wetpaint.com</a> and South Yorkshire Energy Centre <a href="http://www.syec.co.uk/">www.syec.co.uk</a> £20 for the day.
