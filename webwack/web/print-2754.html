		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Heeley City Farm has a target of £1000 to raise from this year’s jumble/nearly new sales and need to take £350 at this last sale to do it. They are relocating to the large polytunnel by the new toilet block this time as it is bigger and the reception building is out of action for a while. 

There will be ladies, mens and childrens clothes and footwear for sale as well as toys, books, household items, bric-a-brac, CDs, DVDs, raffle and lucky dip for kids.

Entry 50p, which includes a raffle ticket (more can be bought if you’d like to help get to the target, at £1 for a strip).
Come and get a bargain, get some Christmas presents bought and help the Farm at the same time! They also welcome donations of good quality clothes and household items for the sale - ring Sheff 2580482 option 6 or email <a href="mailto:s.hardy@heeleyfarm.org.uk">s.hardy@heeleyfarm.org.uk</a> for more info or to arrange drop offs. Hope to see you there! 

<a href="http://www.heeleyfarm.org.uk/">Heeley City Farm</a> is 20 mins walk from Sheffield, Bus 33 or 47.</td>
