		<td>The monthly meeting of CycleSheffield, the group for all kinds of cyclists, with over 500 members. It organises events, information and rides, and campaigns for cycling to be taken seriously as a means of transport, with the facilities it needs. 

A key priority for the coming months is organising a mass participation event to tie-in with the Sheffield Council elections on 5th May. If you are keen to get involved, please contact CycleSheffield or come along to the meeting.

Tea and coffee etc available. Meetings are usually followed by a social in a nearby pub.
