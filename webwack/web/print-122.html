Featuring <strong>The Vegan Night School</strong>. <a href="http://alexlockwood.co.uk/">Dr Alex Lockwood</a> (vegan academic and author of The Pig in Thin Air), Leigh Venus (Minimalists, Newcastle) and Ben Thorne (Anonymous for the Voiceless) share what they’ve learnt from psychology, arts and practice in a fun, non-judgemental interactive session: going vegan, staying vegan. What the science tells us about how people change their lifestyles, and sometimes don’t, and what you can do to help others and yourself live aligned with your values. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/sheffield-students-union/the-vegan-night-school-presents-going-vegan-staying-vegan/632676903879901/">The Vegan Night School Facebook event page</a>
