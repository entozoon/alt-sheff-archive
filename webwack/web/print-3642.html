		<td>Sheffield District Cyclists Touring Club (CTC) celebrate their club centenary with a film show, open to the public. ‘Breaking Away’ is described by the Guardian as ‘Funny, deeply moving, painfully honest: at the end you feel good in a rather special way.’ And if you have ever dreamt of being Alberto Contador, Bernard Hinault or dare we say it, Eddy Merckx or Fausto Coppi – you will not want to miss it. Supported with a film of the CTC club trip to Belgium last year. Tickets are £6, £5 CTC members, available on the door.

Sheffield District CTC covers South Yorkshire and parts of North Derbyshire.
