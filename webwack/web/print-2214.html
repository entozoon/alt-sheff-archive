		<td>Public meeting on the issue of NHS privatisation and cuts. The NHS is at crisis point. Creeping privatisation of health services over recent years has led to the pursuit of profit being introduced to this cherished institution. In Doncaster carers for the disabled employed by private firm Care UK are staging one of the longest strikes in the history of the NHS to secure a living wage for staff working in privatised services formerly run by the NHS.

The meeting will be chaired by local People&#39;s Assembly activist Joe Forde who is a retired former NHS manager and speakers will include Jo Ritson, one of the #March4NHS organisers and Peter Garbutt, local campaigner against TTIP.
