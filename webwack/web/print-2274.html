		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) at Aldermaston and Burghfield are the nuclear bomb factories which make British nuclear warheads. Ahead of an  expected Parliamentary vote in 2016 on whether the government should spend over Â£100 BILLION on a new nuclear weapons system, there will be increasing demonstrations at AWE calling for Trident and its replacement to be scrapped. 

Hundreds of people have been knitting beautiful pieces of pink wool and crochet to connect the AWE factories with a seven mile pink scarf, which will today make its final appearance before travelling to Aldermaston for the national demonstration on Saturday (9th August, the 69th anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki, more details below including transport from Sheffield, for further information email <a href="mailto:hilarysmith23@hotmail.com">hilarysmith23@hotmail.com</a>)

The picnic is in remembrance of the victims of the explosion of atom bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Lord Mayor will sign the Mayor&#39;s Declaration for Peace and there will be music and poetry. Bring a picnic and something to share. IF you fancy helping to set up, arrive from 12.00 noon. Meersbrook Park is 4km south of city centre, off A61 Chesterfield Rd. S8 9FL, take any bus to Meersbrook.</td>
