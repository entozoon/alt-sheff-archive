		<td>Open Rights Group (ORG) Sheffield is the group for anyone interested in digital rights. The national organisation (<a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/">www.openrightsgroup.org</a>) has a legal team looking at implications of GCHQ, Snowden, etc. You don&#39;t have to be a member to come to the meet-ups. 

You may have seen Open Right Group petition against the return of the Snoopers&#39; Charter. In early autumn the Government will publish their proposals for a new law that will extend the surveillance powers of the police and GCHQ. MPs will have until January to examine it. ORG want to get the discussion started now, to tell local MPs what the concerns are. ORG has produced a special briefing pack on how to lobby your MP about the Snoopers&#39; Charter. Using this, ORG Sheffield is running a free workshop where you can learn more about current surveillance laws and how you can win the argument against extending the powers of the police and GCHQ!

Join other Sheffield-based supporters in campaigning for the new legislation to abide by the 6 principles of surveillance as set out in the &#39;Don&#39;t Spy On Us&#39; campaign. The workshop will give you a chance to practice your arguments so that you feel comfortable going to talk to your MP. Talking face to face with an MP is much more effective than emailing them; MPs recognise that if a constituent comes to see them in person, they really care about an issue. Hear about ORG&#39;s main concerns about surveillance and discuss your own. The talk will go through the arguments you can use to put your points across. They&#39;ll also put you in touch with other people in the same constituency so that you can go and speak to your MP together.
