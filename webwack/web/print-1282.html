		<td>Bands, singers and dancers from eleven local schools will battle it out in a competition at the ‘One Sheffield Many Cultures’ festival to be named the best live act.

The free festival is an opportunity for Sheffield‘s young people to showcase our multicultural city with their music and dance talent. The festival, including Swamp Circus, will be a great day for all the family.

OSMC is also very pleased to announce that the festival will be opened by the Lord Mayor and addressed by speakers from local community organisations and campaigns. “One Sheffield, Many Cultures” aims to promote the unity of the city and celebrate the contribution of people from all communities and backgrounds. The movement is non party political and urges people from all walks of life to speak with one voice in opposing racism, bigotry and prejudice.
