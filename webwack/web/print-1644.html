		<td>It’s Harvest time again which means that it’s time for the Autumn Show at Heeley City Farm! 

All amateur food growers in the area, including community groups and schools, can enter home or allotment grown fruit and veg into the Produce Show – there are certificates for the first three placings and a voucher to use in the Garden Centre for winning entries! Bring your entries to the large polytunnel between 11am - 12noon with your form (available at the Farm, from Facebook and the website). Judging is at 1pm

All the usual indoor and outdoor craft, gift, community and food stalls and a bungee ride. Lots of children’s crafts to take part in – Lynwood Kindergarten will be in the Roundhouse Woodland making dens, doing leaf prints, making a mud kitchen and painting. Sheffield Wildlife Trust will also be there with wildlife themed games. Ever popular Veg Monsters will make an appearance – make a model monster from vegetables and enter it into the children’s section of the Produce Show to be judged by special guest the Lord Mayor at 3.30pm.

Other crafts include seed bombs and Autumn Crowns, Face Painting in the Polytunnels and a Farm tombola to help raise funds. There are displays from the Food Growing team at Heeley City Farm; Head Grower Darrell Maryon will be there for gardening advice and Nick Horne will have a honey and bee keeping display. There’s a relaxing Shiatsu massage room to leave your cares and stresses behind in. Watch the Pole Lathing demonstration in the Roundhouse Woodland – Alex will even let you have a go at wood turning. A street artist will be making one of the green storage containers look more colourful on Alexandra Road. Local musician Rosie Attwood Harris will be providing lovely background music, and The Flying Squadron will be landing at the Farm – Amy and Frankie the Owl will be available for photos and a short flying display.

To top it all off there is the Tea Time Sheep Race at about 3.45pm – pick a sheep and if your sheep wins the race into the stables for tea, you get a prize! 

The Energy Centre is holding a warm and well event at the same time with homemade soup. 

FREE admission to the Farm - some activities have a small charge to raise funds for projects. Spread the word!
