		<td>Sharrow Lantern Carnival was set up in 2004 as a celebration of the first anniversary of the end of the Iraq war. The group who originally began the carnival wanted to bring peaceful protest to the streets of Sharrow. Today they still keep to these morals by celebrating the creative community in Sharrow. The carnival takes place annually in April and there are free lantern making workshops running from January every Saturday.

The theme this year is The Ugly Bug Ball! Gather at Mount Pleasant Park at 7.30pm to set off 8pm, parade for an hour and arrive at Sheffield General Cemetery at 9pm. Music and fire spinning until 10.30pm. After-party at The Cremorne, London Road. Volunteers and everyone welcome.
