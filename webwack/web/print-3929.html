		<td>Sheffield Friends of the Earth is showing 4 green films, as voted by the public, on Wednesday 1st, 8th, 15th and 22nd February. The Co-operative has kindly provided financial sponsorship of all the films.

Gasland is going a long way in spreading public awareness about gas drilling and the risks it poses on human and environmental health. When filmmaker Josh Fox is asked to lease his land for drilling, he embarks on a cross-country odyssey uncovering a trail of secrets, lies and contamination. A recently drilled nearby Pennsylvania town reports that residents are able to light their drinking water on fire. This is just one of the many absurd and astonishing revelations of a new country called GASLAND.

A speaker from Friends of the Earth will be available after the film to answer any questions on the issues raised in the film.

Tea, coffee and other refreshments will be available for a small fee. The film festival is free but donations are welcome.
