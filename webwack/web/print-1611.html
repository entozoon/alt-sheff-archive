		<td>The inaugural meeting of the Sheffield Labour Friends of Palestine. Aims include raising awareness within the Labour Party and its affiliates working for a just settlement for the people of Palestine, which holds the state of Israel to account for its violations of international law and human rights. The group hopes to forge an alliance with and between progressive friends of Labour from the diverse communities (including Palestinian and Jewish) in the city, to build trust and work for peace and justice, and a safe environment free of discrimination for debate about issues relating to Palestine and Israel. Supporters include Allan Billings, South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, Nasima Akther, Sheffield City Councillor and Louise Haigh, MP for Sheffield Heeley.

Speakers include:

Nimala Kharoufeh, Chair of the Women's Committee of the youth wing of Fatah, the Palestinian party allied with the UK Labour Party
Linda McAvan, MEP for Yorkshire and Humber
Musheir El-Farra, Palestine Solidarity Campaign
Martin Linton, Palestine Briefing
Paul Blomfield, Member of Parliament for Sheffield Central
