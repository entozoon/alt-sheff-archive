		<td>A special film night hosted by Regather and Green Drinks with a screening of the eye-opening feature length environmental documentary "Cowspiracy". This groundbreaking film follows Kip Andersen as he uncovers the most destructive industry facing the planet today – and investigates why the world’s leading environmental organizations are too afraid to talk about it. Animal agriculture a the leading cause of deforestation, water consumption and pollution, responsible for more greenhouse gases than the transportation industry, and is a primary driver of rainforest destruction, species extinction, habitat loss, topsoil erosion, ocean “dead zones,” and virtually every other environmental ill. Yet it goes on, almost entirely unchallenged. More details on the link below.

Discussion afterwards on the impact of what we eat on Climate Change and what we can do. The idea behind Sheffield Green Drinks is to create links between groups in Sheffield; to allow a space for people involved or interested in community, green, social justice or environmental issues to meet, chat and discuss. If you have a specific idea for a discussion, presentation, topic or any other ideas, please get in touch or bring it along.

Free entry, donations welcome. Green drinks after the film from 8.30pm. There is a full bar selling a range of drinks including beers made on the premises in the Regather Brewery.
