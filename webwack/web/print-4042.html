		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A Sheffield Campaign against Climate Change (SCACC) special event to build up to the 2011 UN climate talks in Durban. UN emission reduction strategies have failed, with CO2 emissions in 2010 the highest on record. Many Southern hemisphere countries have clear alternative strategies but fail to get heard.

Visiting South African film maker Rehad Desai will talk about climate justice and mobilising the climate movement. Rehad Desai is part of organising the protests and demonstrations that will take place in South Africa against the summit, calling for social justice for the people of Africa. The continent is increasingly feeling the consequences of climate change and the calendar of events in South Africa will be important in creating a grass roots movement.

Suzanne Jeffrey, the Chair of the Trade Union group of UK Campaign against Climate Change will also speak.

The meeting will also discuss what we can do to support the struggle for climate justice in Africa and how we can mobilise people for the international day of action over climate that takes place on Dec 3rd in solidarity with the SA protests.

This is a fund-raising social for everyone with an interest in climate justice. Please bring food to share for 6.30pm. Speakers from 7.30pm.
