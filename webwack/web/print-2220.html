		<th>Details</th>
		<td>ASSIST Sheffield’s annual ’World Over Concert’. Come along for an enjoyable evening to enjoy entertaining performers celebrating the global diversity of musical and artistic talent here in Sheffield. All in aid of locally based asylum seekers, helping ASSIST as it challenges asylum destitution.

Among the performers will be Arash (from Iran), Oud (from Saudi Arabia), Queku (from Cote D’Ivoire), the multi-ethnic Sheffield Community Choir, Umubano (from Congo) and The Voxettes. There will be a fashion display by El Addo, and a cameo performance by ASSIST’s own Robert Spooner. This year’s concert is in memory of Myra Davis, the founder of ASSIST, who loved the World Over concerts.

Tickets are £7/£5 in advance from the ASSIST office, or £8/£6 on the door. Contact Sheff 2585715 for more information.
