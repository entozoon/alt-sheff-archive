		<td>Ever seen police at a protest do something you’re sure they shouldn’t? Ever wanted to help out the victims of police bad behaviour? Train to be a Legal Observer with Green and Black Cross, an activist support network providing Legal Observers and training for those involved in protest for social change. 

Whether you're involved in a group or attending as an individual, in this extensive training you’ll learn important skills to support activists. As a Legal Observer, you will note arrests, incidents and police behaviour as well as seeking witnesses. It will cover how to position yourself, what to look out for and some law basics.

Members from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gbcmanchester">Manchester Green and Black Cross group</a> will be coming to Sheffield to train local activists in these vital skills.
