This Session: 
Willow lantern making

At each session we plan a different activity ranging from den building and bug hunting to arts and crafts projects and sports activities. 

The sessions are open access and the young people are free to come and go as they please. 

All of our activities are outdoors so please wear suitable clothing and sensible shoes.
Each session lasts between 2 and 2.5 hours.

We provide refreshments. There is juice and fruit in the sunshine and hot choc in the cold winter months.

Sheffield Wildlife Trust is not a child care provider and under 8’s are welcome to attend but must be accompanied and supervised by a parent or guardian.  We have an Under 8’s activity box with treasure trails and bug hunting activities. 

You don’t need to book but if you are bringing a group please let us know so we can bring sufficient resources.

Got an idea for a session? Email us and we’ll try and include it in our planning.
