		<td>Transforming Cinema is a national film festival, with a focus on the transgender, intersex, gender nonconforming, non binary and genderqueer community. Giving people a platform to broadcast their voices and stories is important because, despite press coverage, there is still a lack of understanding in society at large. Mainstream films rarely touch upon this subject and trans people are suffering because of the widespread ignorance and negativity that often surrounds their depiction in the media. Depression, self-harm and suicide are some of the issues that affect trans people to a much higher rate than non-trans people. Media representation is low and the messages we do hear are negative, unhelpful and even harmful. 

Presenters include:
