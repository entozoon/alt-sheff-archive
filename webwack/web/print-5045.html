		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. Their motto? "We have nothing to lose but our chains!" (But bring locks and lights too, just in case). The plan was to go to Shirebrook Nature Reserve this time, but check their excellent website for details.
