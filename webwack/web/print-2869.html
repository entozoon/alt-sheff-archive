		<td>An event celebrating food growing and allotment culture. Held annually in a different allotment around the city, it demonstrates the links between culture and agri-culture, and the role of creativity and the arts in engaging with our environment, growing food and the seasonal cycles. Allotment holders open up their plots to host an installation or event and artists, performers and poets respond to the particular allotment in creating new, original work in response to the site and the season.
