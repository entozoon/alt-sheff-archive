		<td>CANCELLED: Statement 6 Dec: Meeting cancelled due to the weather situation. They've decided to close the library at 6.30 this evening and if the current situation continues the library is unlikely to be staying open beyond 6.30 on Wednesday. This is to allow staff to get home safely. 
 
We will meet again in January (Wednesday 12th) to discuss our current title 'The Age of Absurdity' by Michael Foley.

A book group based in Sheffield Central Library, reading books that they hope will inspire to build a better future.
