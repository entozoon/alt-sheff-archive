		<th>Details</th>
		<td>This is a group aimed at retired and semi-retired people, socialists, environmentalists, feminists and like-minded people. They walk on the first and third Fridays of each month.

The idea is to do the same walk from Endcliffe Park entrance to the cafe at Forge Dam - about four miles in total - and talk about books, films, the environment or whatever crops up.  Actually, they rarely discuss politics, it is a social group, and the walk is incidental, although the scenery along the river is delightful.

Walkers should wear suitable clothing and understand that they take part at their own risk. After a stop at the cafe, return is usually by 1pm.</td>
