		<td>Guest presenters Unwrapped (zero waste shopping in Sheffield) host this film night on global sustainability. Going “circular” refers to the necessary change from our current take-make-waste linear economy to a borrow-use-return circular economy (sometimes also referred to as the zero-waste or cradle-to-cradle economy). The conclusion; "Unless we go to Circular it’s game over for the planet; it’s game over for society". Tickets £5.
