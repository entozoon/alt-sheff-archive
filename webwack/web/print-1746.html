		<td>Modern Money Theory (MMT) and The Seven Deadly Innocent Frauds of Economic Policy. "The Seven Deadly Innocent Frauds of Economic Policy" is the title of a book by Warren Mosler, a proponent of post-Keynesian Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). Innocent because they reflect conventional wisdom, but deadly because they are destructive and are by far the greatest obstacles to national prosperity.

In this illustrated talk followed by discussion, Nirvana Bloor will debunk some of the myths surrounding taxation, inflation, public deficit and public debt, and will be drawing comparisons between MMT and the Positive Money campaign for sovereign control of the money supply. 

Positive Money talks are held the last Monday of the month; Nirvana is a supporter of MMT and a regular attender at our monthly meetings. Refreshments (50p) from 7pm. Donation requested (suggested Â£3) to cover costs.
