		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Join members of the Free University of Sheffield for a discussion of "The Great University Gamble" by Andrew Gettigan. What will be the role of universities within society? How will they be funded? What kind of experiences will they offer students? Where does the public interest lie? The book describes the new policy regime and developments on the ground, with an urgent warning that our education is now open to commercial pressures which threaten to transform it from a public good into a private, individual investment. 

The group will be reading the introduction of this book, which is <a href="https://andrewmcgettigan.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/mcgettigan_great-university-gamble-introduction.pdf">online here</a> or email newrootsradicallibrary@riseup.net to request a full pdf copy. The venue is accessible through a front door, and a single step up to the back of the shop.
