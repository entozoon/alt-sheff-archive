		<td>Amnesty International and Sheffield Kruzhok are very pleased to jointly welcome Igor Sutyagin to Sheffield, to tell his own story. He was adopted as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International and he wants to meet the people of Sheffield who worked for his release. 
 
Last year he was released after five years' detention in high security prisons in Russia. 
 
Igor Sutyagin, a nuclear scientist, had been sentenced to 15 years in a high security penal colony for alleged espionage.  In fact he has always claimed that he had used open public sources only, and always denied guilt in the charges espionage and devolving state secrets. Amnesty believes the case against him was politically-motivated and that the proceedings against him were marred by violations of international fair trial standards. Amnesty International adopted him as a political prisoner.
 
Last year he was taken to Britain as one of a number of people convicted of spying in Russia who are being exchanged for 10 or 11 individuals alleged by the US to be Russian spies. 
 
All are welcome to come and hear the full story of his years in Russian prisons.
