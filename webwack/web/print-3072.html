		<td>Sheffield Venezuela Solidarity Campaign presents a film by Aleida Guevara. In Britain, the unrestrained free market capitalism that caused the economic crisis is now being offered as the solution to the problem. Cuts and privatisation ensure that those who are less well-off pay for the crisis.

Venezuela shows another way is possible. Since the socialist government came to power in 1998, poverty has been halved, education and healthcare are now completely free, and extreme poverty has been reduced from 30% to 7%. Last year, the economy grew by 5.6%.

This film documents the creation of the social missions at the heart of radical social transformation in Venezuela and contains extensive interview footage with the former president, Hugo Chavez.</td>
