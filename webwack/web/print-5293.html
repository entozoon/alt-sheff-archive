It will also help develop the idea of a Region of Sanctuary, which is beginning to gain a groundswell of support throughout the migration and refugee sectors in Yorkshire and the Humber.

Refreshments and lunch (Halal and Vegetarian) is included. Travel expenses are available for people seeking sanctuary. If you are interested in attending, please tel Sheff 2412780, or email <a href="mailto:bookings@nrcentre.org.uk">bookings@nrcentre.org.uk</a>.
