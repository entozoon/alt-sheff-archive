		<td>One Sheffield Many Cultures and other anti-racism groups are urging everyone from all walks of life in Sheffield to unite in
celebration and defence of One Sheffield Many Cultures this weekend. They strongly oppose plans by the English Defence League (EDL) to demonstrate in Sheffield on Saturday.

The EDL is a racist group dedicated to attacking Asian people and Muslims. Islamophobia – bigotry against Muslims – is as unacceptable as any other form of racism. The EDL’s aim is to divide us by making scapegoats of one community, just as the Nazis did with the Jews in the 1930s. Today they threaten Muslims, tomorrow it could be Jewish people, Hindus, Sikhs, black people, lesbians and gay men, Travellers or Eastern Europeans. There is no place for the fascist EDL in our multicultural and multi-faith city.
