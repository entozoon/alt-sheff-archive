		<td>The International Day Against Homophobia & Transphobia (IDAHO) is designed to raise awareness of the impact of prejudice and discrimination on the health and well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people throughout the world and also on the lives of their families, friends and colleagues. To mark this event, the Centre for HIV and Sexual Health and Sheffield City Council are arranging a ONE-MINUTE ‘NOISE’ on Monday the 17th May to speak out loudly and clearly that homophobia and transphobia are simply not acceptable. You are invited to join in standing up against these forms of prejudice and discrimination.

A number of key speakers will be present to pledge their support and call for an end to homophobia and transphobia worldwide. This event will take place at The Peace Gardens commencing at 5.30pm, the one-minute noise will take place around 6.00pm. You, your friends, families, and partners will be welcome to join in.

The theme this year is 'Sheffield-In The Pink' inviting you to bring pink flags, streamers etc, or wear an item of pink clothing to the event.
