		<td>Got computer problems? BitFixIT Caf√© is a free computer-fixing workshop. Sounds too good to be true? BitFixIT is a group of volunteers who enjoy mending computers and think it is good for the community too. A working PC and internet connection - and a bit of good advice - can help people to stay in touch, know their rights, learn, work, create and be entertained. Computers are important! People need them.
