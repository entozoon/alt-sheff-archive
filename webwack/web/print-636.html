		<td>Four people have died at Morton Hall in the last year. People detained there have been on hunger strike. Morton Hall is run by the Prison Service for the Home Office and can detain 392 people. The Prisons Inspectors on 21 March reported on Morton Hall: “Nearly half the detainees told the inspectors they felt depressed or suicidal on arriving”. Refugees and their supporters will be asking why at this National Demonstration outside Morton Hall Immigration Detention Centre (Swinderby, Lincoln LN6 9PT).

Coach from Sheffield 10.30am outside Crucible Theatre opposite Victoria Hall, Norfolk Street S1 2JB. Returning to Sheffield around 5pm. Book your place by email <a href="mailto:dignitynotdetention@yahoo.co.uk">dignitynotdetention@yahoo.co.uk</a> or text/call mobile 07887 481355. Places are free but the organisers would welcome donations. More info, including flyer to download, and a full report of the previous protest at Morton Hall, on the SYMAAG website.
