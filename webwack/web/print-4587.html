		<td>With the vote to raise tuition fees taking place in Parliament on Thursday 9th December, student rally to show the level of opposition in Sheffield to these proposals. Such proposals could price students out of University, and apply cuts to Higher Education which could cause enormous damage to the city.
        
Meet at Sheffield Students' Union on Western Bank at 12.00 'Unfair Fun Fair', musical chairs, coconut shy and free hot chocolate and cakes, with 'free education' to be confirmed!
Then marching down to Sheffield Town Hall and asking concerned citizens to join in at 12.30 for a rally against the proposals and for an education system which is available to all.
