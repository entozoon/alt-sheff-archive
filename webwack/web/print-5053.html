Are you involved in the community or want to get involved? Do you want to help make a difference? Do you want to share your views and concerns with others and look at ways to make things better? This new course from the WEA (Workers' Educational Association) is for you. It is a FREE 15 hour course. Through discussion and active learning it will examine practical political issues-locally, nationally and globally. It will also consider some political ideas and relate them to the local public services and community assemblies.
