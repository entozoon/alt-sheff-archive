		<td>Monthly meetings for (self-defined) women only, working together politically to campaign for women&#39;s rights, in a safe and supportive space. 

This meeting: "The Women&#39;s Equality Party and Feminism." Following WEP&#39;s policy launch on October 20th, come along and discuss what it means for feminism: is it enough or do we want more?

(NB. The previously advertised BEEP (Bicycles for Education and Empowerment Project) speaker has cancelled, unfortunately.)
