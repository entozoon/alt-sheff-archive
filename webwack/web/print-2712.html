		<td>Christian church service to mark <a href=http://www.worldaidsday.org/">World AIDS Day</a> (1st Dec.) and <a href="http://www.slago.org.uk/tdor/">Trans Day of Remembrance</a> (actually 20th Nov.) 

This is a time to remember the fight against HIV, people who have died, and the estimated 34 million people living with the virus. Also the many who have died because of transphobia, by murder or by suicide as a result of their perceived transgendered identity. These people may have been transsexual, intersex, cross dressers or others, or they may have been mistaken for someone else, but their lives were ended because they did not conform to the gender roles that other people expected of them.
