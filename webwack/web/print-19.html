As part of Israeli Apartheid Week, a talk by Dr Justin Schlosberg, media activist, researcher and senior lecturer in Journalism and Media at Birkbeck College, University of London.

Media news about the Labour Party and anti-semitism has inaccuracies and distortions, omission of essential context or right of reply, misquotations and false assertions consistent with a "disinformation paradigm", he argues.

Dr Schlosberg has written on political power and the media,  and is a co-author of "Labour, Antisemitism and the News: A disinformation paradigm" (2018), and of "Bad News for Labour, Antisemitism, the Party and Public Belief" (2019).

Organised by Sheffield Hallam Students Society and Sheffield University Palestine Society, supported by Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign and Sheffield Labour Friends of Palestine.
