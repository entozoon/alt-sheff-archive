		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The next Sheffield Humanist Society meeting will be "Should Assisted Suicide be Legal?" with Steve Barksby, Dignity in Dying. Is your life your own? Is it just for society to force people to live when they want to die? Should people have the right to ask their loved ones to help them commit suicide? If assisted suicide is made legal how do we protect the vulnerable?
Do we need to take into account family, friends and others who may be affected? Meeting open to all.

The University Arms is close to the tram, Sheffield University stop, and several buses pass nearby including 51 & 52, stopping almost next to the pub, 95 a short walk away. Parking in streets behind the pub.
