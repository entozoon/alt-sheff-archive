		<td>Polite leafletting of Sheffield DocFest about Israel's cultural normalisation of its apartheid policies and practices, including an official Israeli delegation sponsored by British-Israeli Arts, which is a British Council initiative with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Culture and Sport in Israel. 

Sheffield DocFest is a MAJOR  and EXCELLENT FESTIVAL and this is not an attack on it or its delegates; it is a call for an awareness of the politics involved (says the leaflet). In fact the DocFest includes a panel session on the difficulties facing Middle Eastern filmmakers. 

Hundreds of filmmakers and other cultural workers have pledged  not to take money from any institution linked to the government of Israel until Israel complies with international law and universal principles of human rights. 

Festival delegates gather here for lunch and several films will be coming out or going in around this time. This follows previous day's leaflet session (5th). For more details, email <a href="mailto:amartin200@yahoo.co.uk">Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Cultural Boycott Group</a></td>
