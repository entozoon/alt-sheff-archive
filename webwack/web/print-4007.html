		<td>The Healthy Air Campaign in partnership with Sheffield City Council, NHS Sheffield and East End Quality of Life Initiative invite you to the Healthy Air In Sheffield conference.

The campaign believes that if we were able to clean up our air in the 1950s, we can make our air healthy today. With political will from the top and action from the ground up, this public health crisis can be stopped in its tracks. A significant proportion of air pollution is caused by vehicle emissions, particularly the increasing number of diesel vehicles. Active transport choices can improve health, including obesity and heart disease. The Healthy Air Campaign seeks to increase public awareness and understanding of the health impacts of air pollution and help communities mitigate those impacts and adapt to reduce them. It will achieve this by promoting active lifestyles as part of a joined-up sustainable transport, air quality and public health approach within communities, action to effectively monitor, report and reduce air pollution, and advocating a new government air quality and public health strategy.

Speakers confirmed:<ul><li>National Healthy Air Campaign Speaker</li><li>Alan Andrews, Client Earth (currently taking the UK Government to Judicial Review for breaking European air pollution laws)</li><li>Ben Anderson Public Health Consultant NHS Sheffield</li><li>Ted Gunby, Carter Knowle and Millhouses Community Group. Campaign to stop Sainsbury Archer Road extension (The Planning Inspector denied the extension because of the effect of the proposal on local air quality, and consequentially human health)</li><li>Sheffield Air Quality Team, implementing Sheffieldâ€™s Air Quality Action Plan</li></ul>The conference is followed by lunch.
