		<td>Note the change from the usual venue for this monthly meeting to discuss and plan upcoming events and campaigns. Global Justice Now aims to change the actions, policies and institutions of governments, corporations and wealthy minorities, which are preventing an end to poverty and injustice. Part of a global movement, it works alongside people protesting in the developing world. The organising meeting is held on the first Thursday of each month.

Venue: from the trams end of Leopold Street, fork right almost parallel to West Street. Itâ€™s Pinfold Street as far as the Dog and Partridge, on the corner with Bailey Street. Meet in the snug straight in front of you as you come in off the street. Hot snacks available from the bar.
