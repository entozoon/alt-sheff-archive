		<td>A free lecture in which Colin Waugh discusses Gramsci´s attempts to formulate a conception of workers´ education. Working-class adult education seen as a dialogue between industrial militants and people shaped by traditional higher education raises questions which are highly relevant to any attempt to rebuild independent working-class education here and now.

Sheffield Universal Education Collective is a grouping of union activists, students and workers in the higher education sector aiming to provide free and radical, open and democratic education in the city. Inspired by the waves of student protests and activism, they explore means of change through critical thinking about the world.
