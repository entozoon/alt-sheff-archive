&quot;Secular Muslims: On Building Inclusive Religious Spaces&quot;

Tue 7 Apr 2015, 7pm, Farm Road Sports and Social Club, S2 2TP

Sheffield Humanist Society presents a talk by Tehmina Kazi. Women, LGBT people, some disabled people, and members of minority sects and other dissenters have traditionally felt excluded in mainstream Muslim spaces. Tehmina will be talking about ways in which these minorities have created new and innovative spaces for themselves, and built a critical mass against the conservatives.

Tehmina Kazi is Director of British Muslims for Secular Democracy, an organisation which aims to raise awareness of the benefits of democracy and its contribution to a shared vision of citizenship. She is also a contributor to the Guardian newspaper. Prior to joining BMSD, she was a Project Officer at the Equality and Human Rights Commission, where she worked on a ground-breaking inquiry into the Human Rights Act and its impact on public service delivery, undertaking research, writing policy briefings, facilitating focus groups and interviewing victims of human rights violations. She also co-organised the first awards ceremony of its kind to acknowledge the achievements of the UK’s most powerful Muslim women, which received widespread coverage in the national press.

Tehmina has done extensive research on domestic and international human rights issues, particularly religious freedom, the detention of foreign nationals and gender-based violence. She regularly contributes to forums on civil liberties and citizenship.

The meeting itself will start at 7pm, but please feel free to turn up early for socialising if you wish. When you arrive, go into the main entrance and the meeting room is directly on your right hand side. After Tehmina’s talk, there will be time for you to ask her some questions on the subject. Entry to the meeting is free of charge, however the Society requests a voluntarily suggested donation of £3. This contribution goes towards paying for things such as room hire, advertising and speakers expenses. All welcome.
