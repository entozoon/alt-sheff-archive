		<td>What is addiction? Compulsion, behaviour, illness, all three, or none of the above? Do AA and other 12 step recovery programmes really work? And will a skeptic ever admit to needing a higher power? Tania Glyde is the author of Cleaning Up, a memoir about how she took on British drinking culture and survived.

Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. The events are free though they ask for a Â£2 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views.
