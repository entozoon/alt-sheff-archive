		<td>There have been many changes in Sheffield since Sheffield produced its first Food Plan in 2011.  Some changes have been positive, for example the continuing success of the Food Festival, action to improve School Food and the soon to be opened new Market on the Moor. Unfortunately there have also been cuts in welfare and the appearance of Food Banks in the city. The time is right for a refresh of the Food Plan - (now draft Food Strategy) for Sheffield.
