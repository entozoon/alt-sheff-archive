		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Andrea Needham was one of a small group of women who broke into a British Aerospace factory in 1996 and used hammers to disarm a warplane about to be sold to Indonesia to be to be used against civilians in occupied East Timor. Their subsequent arrest and court case effectively led to the British Arms Trade being put on trial. 

Andrea will read from her recently published memoir, and participate in discussion about how lessons learned from the action can be relevant to non violent direction action campaigns today.

The event is free. Donations towards expenses welcome. The evening is part of the Off The Shelf Festival of Words, hosted by Sheffield Creative Action for Peace
