		<td>Michael Heap presents a Skeptics in the Pub get-together about how behaviour, attitudes, beliefs, and even the way we experience events are highly influenced by the demands and expectations of the various roles that we occupy in the course of our everyday life. This may lead us to behave and think in ways that are irrational, questionable and counterproductive.

Michael Heap is a clinical and forensic psychologist with over forty years of experience working both with people with mental health and neurological problems and with criminal offenders. 

Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics. Events are free though they ask for a Â£2 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views.
