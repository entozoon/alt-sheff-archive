		<td>The big show for Sheffield returns this bank holiday. It is a free entry, major, family event in one of Sheffieldâ€™s wonderful parks. 

Expect to find carnival arts, dance and music, interactive cultural workshops, parade with vibrant costumes and performances from local talent. The Fayre will of course feature the legendary Horticultural Show and Craft Tent, food, trade and exhibitor stands, and much more.

Norfolk Heritage Park is very accessible by public transport including Supertram, and plenty of on-street parking, or 15 minutes walk from the city centre.
