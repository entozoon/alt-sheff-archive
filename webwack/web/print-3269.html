		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Demonstration outside the Town Hall against the new Steel House Lap Dancing club proposed, to make a clear statement to promoters that Sheffield people do not want lap dancing clubs and to remind the elected councillors that there is strong opposition to them.

The latest development is that the Planning officer’s report recommends that this application is rejected on a number of grounds. You can view this on Council Planning application on line, under 12/03972 and then click documents. This is great news, but we cannot be complacent as the elected members could reject the recommendations, and the promotors could go for alternative premises.

The application goes to Planning Committee on Monday at 2pm. Assemble at 1.15 for demo and speakers. If you can’t come then write to the Sheffield Planning committee quoting Application Number 12/03972
