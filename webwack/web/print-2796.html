Speaker Ruth Grove-White: Policy Director of Migrant Rights Network. Panel of medical experts and others.
<b><ul><li>‘NHS resources should be spent on patient care, rather than on checking and charging migrants and short term visitors for treatment‘ (British Medical Association)</li><li>‘The proposals will create structures that encourage a discriminatory approach towards certain groups‘ (Royal College of General Practitioners)</li><li>‘If there are migrants in A&E, they are more likely to be working there as doctors and nurses than using the services (30-40% of doctors and nurses are currently born outside of the UK).‘ (Still Human Still Here)</li></ul></b>
