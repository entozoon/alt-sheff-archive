		<td>Public rally for the final day of the university occupation, which will be joined by trade unionists from Sheffield. Students occupying at Sheffield University have decided to continue until the next day of action on Sunday. The occupation (of the Richard Roberts auditorium, the first university building on the right as you go up Western Bank from the roundabout) is against the vicious education cuts. This is a meeting in the large lecture theatre they have occupied and inviting trade unionists and others to come and join the discussion and show support for their occupation.
