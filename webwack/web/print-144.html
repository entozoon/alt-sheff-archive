		<td>Rotherham Greens supported by neighbouring local Green Parties in Doncaster and Barnsley are working hard to win their first Council seat and they need help (they don't accept large donations from large corporations so they rely on members and supporters to help).

To support their fundraiser, please sign up for a fun night of  music and food (and they are promising a good quiz). Entry £8 for adults and £5 for children.
