		<td>The Communist Workers’ Organisation and the Free Communist joint public meeting.

Since the so-called ’subprime crisis’ in 2008, austerity budgets have been forced down the throats of the working class in all countries at the heart of the capitalist world. In Québec, the first austerity budget in 2010 led to a the biggest student strike in the history of the province, as well as other mass protests, riots, and the beginning of the self organisation of the working class.

The meeting will be introduced by Alexis Blanchard, ex-member of the student strike committee, CLASSE, ex- member of the national mobilisation committee ASSÉ, and member of the Internationalist Workers Group, Canadian affiliate of the Internationalist Communist Tendency. 

All Welcome.
