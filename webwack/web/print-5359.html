		<td>All welcome to help plan the campaign strategy for 2010, which is particularly important as this is an election year and given the proposal that South Yorkshire will be home to the new Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (NAMRC). The NAMRC will be the focus for the majority of the UK civil nuclear manufacturing industry supply chain. Yorkshire Forward will be investing up to Â£10million. Rolls Royce also plans to place its civil nuclear facility in South Yorkshire.

CND believes that nuclear is a dirty, dangerous and expensive form of power, adding to the threat of nuclear proliferation, contamination by toxic waste and nuclear accidents and adding to carbon emissions.

COME AND JOIN CND IN OPPOSITION TO NUCLEAR POWER.
