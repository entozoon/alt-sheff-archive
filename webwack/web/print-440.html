		<td>Reclaim the Power is a national network of activists that works with communities across the country to fight for climate justice.

Fracking has started but the movement to oppose this unwanted and reckless industry is blossoming. Three important protesters have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/17/court-quashes-excessive-sentences-of-fracking-protesters">freed</a> because the court said their sentences were excessive, for expressing a firm commitment by peaceful direct action. We can end fracking in Lancashire and fossil fuel extraction all over. Reclaim the Power 2018 national gathering is in Sheffield so now is the time to join. It doesn’t matter whether you are an old or new face, they say, or whether this is the first time you’ve dabbled in activism. This is a key time to get stuck in!

Reclaim The Power meetings use consensus decision making to develop strategies and make plans to take direct action in the name of climate justice. Gatherings are also a space to get empowered, meet new people, and learn from one another.

The venue is close to the city centre, fully accessible, with vegan lunches on both days, and tea, coffee and biscuits. A Solidarity Travel Fund is operated to help people attend gatherings who would otherwise not be able to do so. Please email <a href="mailto:finance@nodashforgas.org.uk">finance@nodashforgas.org.uk</a> if you need help with the costs of your travel, and try to book your transport ASAP to save money, so that the fund can help as many people as possible to attend. They will also organise for ’crash space’ for people who live outside Sheffield, so that you have somewhere to stay and sleep on Friday and Saturday evening if required. For details and any other questions please email <a href="mailto:info@reclaimthepower.org.uk">info@reclaimthepower.org.uk</a> or post below.
