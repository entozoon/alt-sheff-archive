		<td>Course about learning, experiencing and celebrating the seasonal harvest. This is a time of year for nourishing our bodies, eating fresh food from the earth, cooking, and preserving away that which we have surplus of, so that we may keep using the food throughout the winter and spring. It is also a time to prepare the allotment garden for winter, keeping ground covered and ready for spring time. Autumn is also a good time to begin to look at compost heap building. More details on the website below.

Cost Â£50 for full weekend (14 hrs teaching). Concession rates available. Contact for more info Stephen 07507 578885. 8 places are available for this course, so booking early is advisable. Bring some food to share. Cooking lunch both days from shared, foraged and harvested ingredients.
