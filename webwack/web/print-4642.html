		<td>From the people who brought you Cinema Ponderosa... No Limits Film Festival are teaming up with Magnificent Revolution to create a Cycle-In Cinema Installation and Screening. 

They will be employing a single bicycle powered projector to project onto various locations in Ponderosa Park. The single bicycle powered projections will lead down to a larger 8 bicycle powered projection at the bottom of Ponderosa Park. Attendees will be able to interact with the projection via pedalling to keep it going or they can just sit back, relax and watch some films.
