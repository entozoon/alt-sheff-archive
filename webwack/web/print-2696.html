		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Glasgow Media Group&#39;s latest book, Bad News for Refugees by Greg Philo, Emma Briant and Pauline Donald examines how migrants (especially asylum seekers) have been stigmatised in political rhetoric and media coverage, and the impact of this on wider British society. On International Human Rights Day, Dr Briant will speak about the book and will hope to engage discussion on how it is possible to work towards both a better informed media and more humane policy. There will also be a short introduction from Jairo Lugo-Ocando to a new project developing journalism training for refugees followed by the discussion and time for networking and refreshments.
