		<td>October sees the 75th anniversary of the Jarrow March, from  the industrial North to London, a major protest against unemployment during the 1930s depression. The UK now has a  scandalous figure of nearly 1 million young people unemployed. 

<a href="http://www.youthfightforjobs.com/">Youth Fights for Jobs</a>, a national trade union-backed campaign against youth unemployment is marching from Jarrow to London between 1st October and 5th November, coming through Sheffield on Wednesday 12th October, the day that October's unemployment figures will be announced. 

Locally, <a href="https://sheffieldanticuts.wordpress.com/">Sheffield Anti Cuts Alliance</a> will be supporting, with protest events planned.</td>
