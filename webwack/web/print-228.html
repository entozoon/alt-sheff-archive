		<td>Donald Trump is coming to the UK for a full state visit with a procession down the Mall in a golden carriage. But there won’t be any cheering crowds. Last year, a quarter of a million mobilised to say no to Trump’s politics of hate and division. This time there may be even bigger numbers - to fight for migrant and refugee rights, for women’s rights, against the corporate elites, war, and for the future of our planet.

Together Against Trump is organised jointly by the Stop Trump Coalition and Stand up to Trump. Transport from Sheffield is being organised by Sheffield Stand Up To Racism. Book your coach tickets from Sheffield to London via the link below.
