		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. 

This time the theme is "Railways IV". The last of four SFNR Railways rides, after routes west to Totley (I), south-east to Woodhouse (II) and north to Chapeltown (III). They will probably be cycling to the railway at Stocksbridge. Full details on the website. All welcome.
