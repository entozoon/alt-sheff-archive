		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes.

This month's theme is Sheffield's 5 remaining Vestry Halls, which apparently were administrative and social centres before the Victorian local government reforms and creation of towns, boroughs, cities etc.
