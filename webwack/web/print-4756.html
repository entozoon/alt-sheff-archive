		<td>On an industrially-polluted, military-ruled, almost dying planet, it's good to know that there are people pointing the way out of the work-till-you-drop rat race. Resisting consumer culture with a space for the free sharing of skills, ideas, knowledge and fun, the Sheffield Social Centre group is offering a glimpse of another reality. How to live almost for free, with real human community interactions, not "business as usual". Later, the group intends to establish a permanent space for non-hierarchical, anti-capitalist and non-discriminatory activity in Sheffield. Meanwhile here's what's planned for this weekend...
<b>
<ul><li>Free shop all weekend! Bring and share clothes, books, anything ...
</li><li>Drop-in bicycle workshops
</li><li>Environmental crafts for kids
</li><li>Urban Scrumping - living off the land, in the city...

</li><li>Yoga
</li><li>Samba!
</li><li>Non-hierarchical decision-making - no leaders, no led: group consensus as a way of organising
</li><li>Organising in the modern workplace - politics and activism for those lucky/unlucky enough to have a job
