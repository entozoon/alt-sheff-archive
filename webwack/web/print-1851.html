		<td>Devolution and Sheffield - how far should it go? A discussion with public questions looking at the impact of devolution on the city. What do we want and what might we get? A panel of politicians, including Paul Blomfield MP and Green Councillor Jillian Creasy, community activists and academics talking about and fielding questions on one of the hot topics of the general election campaign. In association with Nigel Slack, Active Citizen.

The Festival of Debate is taking place in Sheffield in the run-up to the General election, during March and April. It provides opportunities to get together and discuss a range of issues which affect everyone. Informed decision making and strategic planning are essential for democracy, so come and get involved. They also welcome volunteers, from attending events and taking part in discussions to volunteering time to help run an event, promote the festival and much more. Unless otherwise stated events are free to attend, but if possible please register via the appropriate Eventbrite link on the Festival of Debate website below to give organsisers an idea of numbers.
