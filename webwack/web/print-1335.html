		<td>Note the earlier start time for meetings of CDAS, which fights for asylum seekers who live in Sheffield to be allowed to stay in the UK. These people have become our friends, and contribute to the cultural identity of the city, yet many live in fear of deportation, torture, physical abuse or even death.
