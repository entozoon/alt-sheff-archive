		<td>A new space in Sheffield, with room for people to stay and get involved, and potential for events and projects was briefly opened but seems to have been closed. Despite squatting commercial property not being a criminal offence, it seems that the authorities in Sheffield can clamp down very quickly.

Further information on squatting in general is available from <a href="http://www.squatter.org.uk/">The Advisory Service for Squatters</a></td>
