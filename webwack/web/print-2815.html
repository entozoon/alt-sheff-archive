The Hysterical Injury: Noise-pop duo who will tear your ears off. Sweetly. 
Big Joan: From Bristol, described as Gang-of-Four-meets-the-Slits-at-a-DJ-hype-gig.
Honeybuzz: Slacker garage pop band from Sheffield, fuzzy, dreamy, surf, garage pop and punk rock.
Elopes: The Steel City’s very own queer, femme two pieces. Rather brash, rather noisy, ever so slightly feminist too. 

£4 suggested donations, DJs to be confirmed but there will be dancing till late.

LaDIYFest Sheffield is a DIY, anti-capitalist, community based, feminist festival run by volunteers, led primarily by women but all are welcome to get involved. It aims to highlight female and LGBTQ art, projects and activism in the community, promoting social change in a non-discriminatory environment through music, performance art, spoken word, films, discussions, art exhibitions and practical workshops etc.
