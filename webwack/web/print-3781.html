		<td>A one-man silent protest by activist Andy Cropper with his mouth gagged, alleging illegalities in the recent bill. He raises serious issues about flaws in the legislation processes and plans, which the mainstream media and politicians have so far ignored. Please stop if you are nearby and give him some support. 

His previous protest was covered on <a href="http://economicsurvivor.net/2012/04/18/silent-protest-over-health-and-social-care-illegalities">Economic Survivor blog</a> and more details at <a href="http://postcardcafe.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/will-sheffield-city-council-prevent-the-government-from-dismantling-the-nhs">Postcard Cafe</a></td>
