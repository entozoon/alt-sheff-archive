		<td>Part of Sheffield Pride Week, leading up to Sheffield Pride’s main event on Sat. 6th of July. Studio 54 - one of the newest and most vibrant bars in Sheffield - are hosting Sheffield Pride’s very first secret cinema. Whilst the downstairs bar offers great drink prices and plays some smashing tunes, the upstairs club room gets transformed into a spacious and comfortably quirky secret cinema! Two films will be shown on the night using a large projector with crisp surround sound. Entry is FREE all night and so is the popcorn!
