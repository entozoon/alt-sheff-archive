		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Occupy Sheffield, like occupations all over the world, is a people&#39;s protest against the current unsustainable, undemocratic and unjust system. They work towards alternatives; structural change towards authentic global equality where the resources of the world go towards caring for people and the planet, not the military, corporate profits or the rich. This is what democracy looks like. 

They are currently holding general assemblies where everyone is welcome.
