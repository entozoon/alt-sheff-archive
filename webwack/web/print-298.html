		<td>Extinction Rebellion Sheffield training session in non-violent direct action. Life as we know it is falling apart. Extreme weather events and mass species extinction cover the globe. The government has failed to implement radical change and environmental organisations have failed to take sufficient action. ItÂ´s time to rebel. Join the Extinction Rebellion introduction to non-violent direct action - both theory and practice.

 What are your rights? How do you de-escalate tense situations? Affinity groups are forming around the country to take part in a series of escalating disruptions. This training will include briefing about the Rebellion, action essentials and practice of nonviolent techniques, and create affinity groups for people in the Sheffield area.

Note this venue is only accessible via a stairway. Please book your place on the link below.
