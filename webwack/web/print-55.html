		<td>An open meeting to hear an update and discuss, after the success of the petition for a referendum which may remove Sheffield City Council’s "Strong Leader and Cabinet" style. This very short BBC report explains the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/woll.newall/videos/10157355063717499/">local referendum</a>. Supporters are urged to attend this important meeting about the upcoming referendum - your input and ideas are crucial!

After the public meeting, everyone is very welcome to stay on for the Annual General Meeting (approx. 3.45/4.00 till 4.30pm). New Coordinating Group members will be voted in - please consider this. Skills needed include social media, working with and writing letters to the press, graphics/leaflets/posters, fundraising, creating events or just something as ’simple’ as running meetings. Please contact the chair on <a href="mailto:rhubba4@gmail.com">rhubba4@gmail.com</a> if you have any questions.

To formally vote at the AGM or to sit on the CG you need to be a signed-up member of It’s Our City! It’s just a quick form to fill, in advance, they won’t be able to process membership applications on the day. Details are here: <a href="https://www.itsoursheffield.co.uk/membership/">It’s Our City membership</a> (including information about how they maintain independence from political parties as a community network). The meeting will be on the second floor which is accessible via lift. The ground floor cafe will also be open for food and drinks.
