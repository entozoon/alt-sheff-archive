		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Celebrating Fairtrade Fortnight 2016, Principle 5 (Yorkshire Co-operative Resource Centre) has organised this special free talk with guest speaker Paul Birch, followed by general discussion. All welcome.

After many successful years with the famous Revolver Records label, Paul Birch stepped away from focusing solely on music to set up Revolver Co-operative in 2011. Revolver World Coffee is now sold in around 400 Co-operative stores and 50 other shops. Revolver is proud to be part of the Fairtrade Foundation – reinvesting 25% of profits back into the farmers and their communities. He will talk about their radical commitment to the co-operative movement.
