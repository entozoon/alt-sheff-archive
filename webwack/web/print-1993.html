		<td>Do something different for Valentines day; come and be part of the global movement for a worldwide decision to end violence against women, One Billion Rising. 

1 in 3 women will be raped or beaten in their lifetime.

One billion women violated worldwide is an atrocity

One billion women dancing is a revolution. There are activities leading up to 14th February. Colours to wear for the flash dance are black with red/pink/orange. Bring an umbrella of the same colours in case it rains!

Part of the global One Billion Rising / V Day campaign, a group of individuals and organisations across South Yorkshire have come together to rise up against violence against women and girls through a variety of creative activities for February 14th 2015. They are also encouraging other individuals (women and men) and organisations to drum, dance and rise and demand an end to the violence.
