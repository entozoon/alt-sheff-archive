		<td>Come and enjoy a delicious (skipped) vegan meal in the stunning Lynwood Gardens, Broomhall, plus cake for afters! A get-together round the bonfire to raise some money (and awareness) for the Sheffield Social Centre project.  Suggested donation Â£3, or whatever you can afford. Bring your friends and spread the word... social change never tasted so good!

Sheffield Social Centre is a collective for anti-capitalist, non-hierarchical, liberated space in the city.
