After the European elections - How do we stop the rise of the far right? Around the world we are seeing a rise in the racist and fascist forces on a scale not witnessed since the 1930s. From Trump in the States to Bolsonaro in Brazil, Le Pen and Salvini in Europe, and Tommy Robinson in the UK, the far right feel emboldened by growing Islamophobia, antisemitism and racism. Ongoing institutionalised racism and the disgusting scapegoating of migrants, Muslims and refugees from the top of the establishment only acts to fan the flames of the far right forces seeking to exploit the Brexit crisis. 

We must stand together, whatever our different views on Brexit, and unite against them. We have to build a mass anti-racist movement to end the "hostile environment" and celebrate and defend our multiculturalism and diversity. This conference is for anyone wanting to fight racism and the rise of the far right. 

Includes community meal fundraiser for refugees, film showing - organising against racism in the workplace, and workshops: Kick Racism out of Football; Challenging the Rise of the far-right; Institutional Racism, Islamophobia and anti-semitism; War and climate chaos: solidarity with refugees and asylum seekers.

Organised and hosted by Yorkshire and Humber TUC and Stand Up To Racism, to end the Migration Matters festival/Refugee Week. Register for free on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/yorkshire-tuc-stand-up-to-racism-regional-conference-tickets-63380149734">Eventbrite</a>
