		<td>An evening of sounds with Anton Mobin, Alex McLean, Benedict Taylor and Adrian Beentjes, covering several forms of the improvised music scene. This takes the totally DIY approach to music, using hand-made instruments and software.

Anton Mobin broadcasts regularly on the FM station of the French Anarchist Federation, Radio Libertaire. This is his only Sheffield performance before his appearance in the Sonic Protest festival, in April in Paris.
