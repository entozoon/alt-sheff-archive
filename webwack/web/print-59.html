		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A two day course as part of a new initiative: <strong>The British College of Mutual Aid</strong>, formed in Sheffield by the Foodhall project, Access Space and Redhaus books. It explores how we organise in a collective way by exchanging theories of best practice and alternative economics, the practical models needed to sustain social, architectural and creative collectives and the hurdles we all face, as the social movement has more contributors.

The British College of Mutual Aid is an alternative to current education, enabling contribution to the collective knowledge on a wider scope of views, including views which don’t have any academic platform. It overcomes the age and financial boundaries of the current UK education system by open and equal access. 

Over the weekend participants and collaborators are invited to come and live together over a two day period in a more immersive and alternative approach to learning and teaching one other.

Contributors include Fran Edgerly of Assemble London, Monika Kostera, academic and author of Occupy Management!, Susie Steed, co-founder of the Brixton Pound, Dougald Hine of the Dark Mountain Project recorded an interview especially for this event about creating effective networks of self-organising projects, Larisa Blazic, artist and academic, researching how Blockchain can empower local communities, Maria Pastuskh,  SESAM slavaytich and Elina Dzinovic, EASA Real. (And more to be announced).

Please note there will be a ticket price to suit you. Tickets from £0 to £30, but not being able to afford it should not be an obstacle to attending. This idea is new and it’s the first event under this banner. They are also looking for more venues who would be happy to deliver programmes under the banner of the British College of Mutual Aid.
