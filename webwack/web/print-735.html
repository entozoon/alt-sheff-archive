		<td>Fracking is a nightmare, causing toxic and radioactive water contamination, severe air pollution and adding to climate change. Tens of thousands of wells, pipelines and compressor stations are planned to devastate our countryside and blight communities. Ineos, a company licensed for fracking around Sheffield are targeting rural areas such as Penistone to carry out seismic testing.

 A presentation for Penistone and District Probus Club. (Sorry there is no start time online)
