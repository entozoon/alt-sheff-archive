		<td>This musical play has a well-respected place in our city&#39;s history. First produced in the 1960s, it tells a story based on events a century earlies. The &#39;Rattenings&#39;, also known as &#39;The Sheffield Outrages&#39; was a struggle between The Saw Grinder&#39;s Union and non-union labour, culminating in the murder of a non-union worker. Eventually a government board of enquiry was set up to investigate the grinding trade and its working conditions.

Presented by Sheffield University Drama Society. Tickets £9, concessions £7.
