		<td>The Land Justice Network is a network of groups, individuals and networks who recognise the need to change the way land is owned, used, distributed and controlled in the UK. Join them to hear what they have been doing, and plot fresh action together!

Followed on Sunday 19th by a Peak District walk, hoping to meet some of those affected by the recent fires on Saddleworth Moor, connected to the mismanagement of moors for grouse shooting.
