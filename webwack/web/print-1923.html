		<td>"Time To Act" is a day of climate change creative events. The UN climate talks in Paris this December are crucial to protect all that we love. So far the pledges on the table are nowhere near enough.  Here in Sheffield we are part of a growing movement, more diverse and more determined than ever before. We know what needs to be done, the solutions are here now. Climate has to be at the top of every political agenda.

 Join in two months before the election for a mass demonstration and wake-up call. The 2014 People&#39;s Climate March saw 400 people on the streets in Sheffield, 40,000 people in London and 400,000 people in New York. The film <a href="http://watchdisruption.com/">‘Disruption’</a> shows the mobilisation for New York – get inspired!

<strong>There are various Sheffield willow sculpture and banner-making sessions throughout February, in preparation - see dates shown above. </strong>
