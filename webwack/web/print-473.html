ASSIST Sheffield supports some of the most vulnerable people who have been unsuccessful in their applications for asylum and as a result have been made destitute. Many of them have escaped the unimaginable horrors of war, violence and persecution. Without refugee status, asylum seekers are not allowed to work. Once their initial application for asylum has been turned down many are left homeless and destitute with no right to housing, benefits or other vital support, so ASSIST is an invaluable lifeline.
