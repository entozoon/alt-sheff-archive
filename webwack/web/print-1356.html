		<td>Launched in 2012, Stop G4S is a coalition of activists and human rights groups dedicated to opposing G4S and working with others to Stop G4S from taking over our public services for private profit while violating human rights.

G4S is the world´s largest private security company, with UK government contracts alone worth over £600 million. Responsible for security services, welfare to work programmes, detention centres, prisons, and asylum seeker housing, they have a track-record of human rights abuses from complicity in the illegal transfer and detention of Palestinian political prisoners to forcing refugees to live in slum housing. Yet they seek to profit from the Government´s privatisation programme by taking over our public services! And they are just getting bigger, last year they made over £531 million in profit (that´s well over 800million USD) with revenues of over £7.5 billion. 

G4S is complicit in human rights abuse throughout the world. It lost the contract to deport people from the UK after Jimmy Mubenga, an Angolan asylum seeker died, following restraint by G4S employees. A Parliamentary report confirmed that ‘inappropriate physical and possibly dangerous restraint techniques’ were used. G4S Israel provides equipment & services to Israeli prisons in which Palestinian prisoners, including child prisoners, are illegally held. There is compelling evidence of torture and of child abuse in these prisons. G4S also provides security for illegal settlements, the apartheid wall and checkpoints which maintain Israel´s unlawful occupation and racist control.
