		<td>A discussion with FareShare Yorkshire, FoodCycle, Gareth Roberts and Regather, Heeley City Farm, New Roots, Timebuilders and Isaac Tendler of Foodhall. 

Accompanied by a meal provided by volunteers. Part of <b>The National Food Service Symposium</b>, the first of its kind on the emerging non-hierarchical, non-charity, open source social eating movement. It aims to foster a collective knowledge base at a time of significant social innovation among problems of food poverty, social isolation and exclusion, and food waste. Imagine a future with free eating spaces on every street. The Foodhall Project Sheffield examines this utopian vision, with a series of free talks and meals. Free to attend, part of the 2018 Festival of the Mind.
