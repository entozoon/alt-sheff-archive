		<td>The last few years have seen substantial investment and some major successes in boosting cycling in urban areas. It is possible to get more people cycling, more safely, and more often. With wider transport funding under pressure, and the new focus provided by the Local Sustainable Transport Fund, there is now the opportunity for a renewed focus on the massive potential that exists for delivering wider transport and environmental goals through raising cycling levels in urban areas in cost effective ways. 

This conference provides an opportunity to hear from some of the most successful urban cycling initiatives in the UK and to identify the best and most cost effective ways of bringing about a stepchange in the levels of urban cycling outside London. 'Going up a Gear' will bring together the key players along with cycling groups and environmental pressure groups.

Chance to hear from a leading line-up including: Keynote Address from Norman Baker MP Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Peter Lipman Policy Director Sustrans, Phillip Darnton Chairman Cycling England, Councillor Paul Scriven Leader Sheffield City Council, John Bann Head of Transport & Highways Sheffield City Council.

Attendance starts from Â£99 plus VAT.
