		<td>Paul Robeson was a famous black actor and singer (you may have heard his classic "Old Man River"), who became an influential critic of racial and class discrimination. He suffered years of public abuse, passport loss and cancelled bookings as he was persecuted for his radical politics and civil-rights campaigning. This one-man show by Tayo Aluko comes from Carnegie Hall with an important story about attitudes to dissent in the USA. Whether or not you know about him, this will be a memorable experience.
