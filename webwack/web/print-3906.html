		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The Upper River Don, from the middle of the city to the northwest area of Hillsborough, is a lost world. Despite running parallel with a major road and close to the Supertram track it is almost invisible. For a large part it is also inaccessible, cut off by private car-parks, industrial estates and empty sites. This section of river is full of surprises: derelict water wheels, curiously named islands such as Bacon Island and an abandoned graveyard.

This event will feature an exhibition of works by Masters of Urban Design students, photographer Eric Winnert, and the works of Studio Polpo and the Shalesmoor, Kelham Island & Neepsend Network (SKINN). In addition there will be a short series of lectures and presentations by organisations and individuals involved in activities related to the river. 

The aim of the project is to highlight the current state of abandonment of this stretch of the river and propose and showcase various solutions. The project hopes to spark conversations between various groups involved in the projects along the river and hopefully initiate new projects and well as get people of the area involved in the debate.

Speakers from: Sheffield School of Architecture (SSoA), Riverlution & River Stewardship Company, Point Blank Theatre Company, SKINN, CADS. An event in conjunction with Studio Polpo, University of Sheffield School of Architecture, SKINN and Eric Winnert.

Seating spaces are limited, so please book at: <a href="http://rivercommons.eventbrite.com/">http://rivercommons.eventbrite.com</a>
