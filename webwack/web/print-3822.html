		<td>A Psychology in the Pub event. Transsexuality, more commonly called trans, is increasingly portrayed in the media in ways which perhaps do not reflect the reality of trans people&#39;s lives. Similarly, the treatment to change trans people&#39;s bodies so they are in line with their minds, and the science underlying this, is also commonly misunderstood. At this event, Christina Richards - senior specialist psychology associate at the largest NHS Gender Identity Clinic in the UK - will present the current science regarding trans people and will look at gender as it relates to everyone, trans or otherwise.
