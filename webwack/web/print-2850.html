		<td>In 2012 Música Aurea from Santiago in Cuba sang at a series of concerts in and around Sheffield bringing Cuban choral music to Sheffield for the first time. The tour’s success exceeded all expectations and the quality of the music was a real revelation. Maggie Campbell and Lizzie Mussell from <a href="http://www.vocesdecuba.org.uk/w/doku.php?id=sheffield_events">Voces de Cuba</a> will talk about choral music in Cuba and will tell the story of how a socialist choir in Sheffield came to invite a Cuban choir here to visit. With video recorded during the trip and Cuban songs sung by Sinsontes, this is an inspiring story of real friendship across boundaries and how to have a dream and make it happen. Part of a series of meetings on cultural themes  inspiring interest in Cuba organised by Sheffield Cuba Solidarity Campaign.

Entry FREE, but suggested donation to cover costs £2 per person.
