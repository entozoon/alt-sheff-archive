		<td>There is growing evidence that the Government "Prevent Strategy" has become a tool for intimidating and isolating Muslim communities. Teachers, youth workers, imams, etc. are recruited to become "thought police" and a part of the population feels under threat. The actions of a tiny number of fanatics are being used to clamp down on expressing views that disagree with government policies, on such matters as Syria or Palestine.

 Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign and Rotherham Friends of Palestine are pleased to welcome a community activist from Birmingham, Salma Yaqoob, to speak on this issue. The venue is a short walk from Rotherham bus and rail stations. Full details on the link below.
