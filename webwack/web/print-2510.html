		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Informal discussion of French economist and expert on wealth inequality Thomas Piketty and his seminal new work "Capital in the 21st Century". Piketty recommends that any consideration of economics must be combined with an understanding of politics. He argues that higher taxes on wealth and income are needed to confiscate capital gained by the wealthy that is due not to their work but them being in a position where the value of their work is difficult to measure.

The meeting will be hearing a couple of extracts from his lectures: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbdYmEXIEvkqObNCW5ASQV2lUP9FvRSS_">Click to see on YouTube</a>
