After the City Council/AMEY chopping down of trees on Rustlings Road in the early hours of the morning, five people were charged. They appear in court accused of offences relating to preventing people from working, under legislation passed by the Conservative government designed to suppress trade union activity. 

There will be a rally outside the court at 9am to support the protesters.

Dave Dillner and Helen McIlroy from Sheffield Tree Action Groups (STAG) were interviewed about the issue on <a href="https://youtu.be/O1lymUwY2KY">Sheffield Live Radio</a>
