		<td>Discussing income equality, this week with a game called <i>Bother your MP (with a very short letter)</i>. The suggested campaign is stopping the dismantling of the Child Trust Fund, but you are welcome to bring your own. See the <a href="http://www.onesociety.org.uk/?page_id=317">One Society "policy wheel"</a> if you want inspiration. You do not have to write, it is not proposed as a serious exercise, but they will get sent.
