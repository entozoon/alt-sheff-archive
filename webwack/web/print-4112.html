		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (SFNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. This time the theme is "Now 42! I love SHF!" What? Why? Sheffield is hosting a cycling conference on 15th October. The conference is about how cycling campaigns can respond to and work with "localism", so this SFNR is part of that, to show visitors some aspects of Sheffield. Why Now 42!?, well 42 is the answer to life, the universe and everything ... and this is also the 42nd SFNR.
