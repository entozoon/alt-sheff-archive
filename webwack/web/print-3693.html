		<td>A free exhibition accompanying the conference (22nd-24th June) in celebration of the life and work of socialist educator, scholar, anthroposophist and actor Arnold Freeman (1886-1972). He worked tirelessly to improve the life experience of Sheffield people, using education, theatre and social projects. The exhibition features a selection of papers and photographs of the Sheffield Educational Settlement, one of the projects in which he was involved in the first half of the 20th century. 

The event is sponsored in memory of Rachael and Sam Davison, who were members of the settlement, and actors in The Little Theatre. For further details email <a href="mailto:Kenneth.gibson25@gmail.com">Kenneth.gibson25@gmail.com</a>
