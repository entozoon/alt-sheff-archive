		<td>While all healthcare systems are struggling to manage this crisis, the people in Gaza are especially vulnerable. Thirteen years of Israel’s illegal siege, repeated bombings, and the deliberate maiming of protesters in the Great March of Return have stretched the fragile healthcare system to breaking point.

Gaza is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, yet there are only 2,800 hospital beds and 60 working ventilators for the roughly 2 million people living there. <strong>Restrictions imposed by Israel’s illegal blockade</strong> mean the infrastructure simply isn’t there to deal with this pandemic. Thousands will unnecessarily die unless urgent action is taken now. In this day of action, join Palestine Solidarity Campaign in their online campaign to get the blockade lifted, via social media and letters.
