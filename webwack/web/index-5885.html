	<p class="message">CycleSheffield and other campaign groups are mounting a national campaign to exert political influence up to the council elections in May 2014, to put safe space for walking and cycling on the agenda of all the political parties. Sheffield councillors are responsible for Sheffield&#39;s streets and urban space.  Asking them for their views on, or support for, demands during the election campaign will help make cycling a genuine transport choice for Sheffielders.
<br><br>
What specific demands are to be made? This is to be decided by the end of Jan 2014. Here is a list of suggestions so far. If you may have others you want to add why not get in touch? (Remember it must be things local councillors are in charge of). 
<ul><li><strong>    The needs of vulnerable road users put first in all planning and highways developments. 
</strong>
Pedestrians, people in mobility scooters, and cyclists are vulnerable road users and all planning and development in Sheffield must start with a walking and cycling audit.
</li><li><strong>
Protected space on main streets and through major junctions. </strong>Sheffield needs to install segregated cycle paths on major streets with fast and/or high volumes of traffic. Major junctions that leave cyclists vulnerable should be redesigned.
</li><li><strong>Removal of motorised through-traffic from minor streets.</strong> Minor streets should not become rat-runs. Most residential streets are minor streets and cutting out through-traffic would make them much safer. There should be permeability for pedestrians, mobility scooters and cyclists.</li><li><strong>
Quicker implementation of 20 mph speed limits. </strong>SCC has a policy of installing 20 mph zones but the speed of installation is too slow. At the present rate of seven zones a year the remaining 110 zones will be completed within another 16 years, by which time CycleSheffield want at least 10% of trips on bikes. 
</li><li><strong>
Safe walking and cycling routes for schoolchildren and students.</strong> Every child in Sheffield should be able to safely walk or cycle to school or college. SCC  has trained 1000s of schoolchildren to cycle safely on the road.  But they won&#39;t do it because: parents think the roads are unsafe; schools have inadequate safe and secure bike storage. Cycling to school or college should be safe and secure, bike storage should be available. This will reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, raise youngsters&#39; levels of health and well being, and ensure that young people learn good road sense and have autonomy to move around without them, or their parents, being fearful.
</li><li><strong>
Safe cycling routes through and around the city centre and suburban centres. </strong>Sheffield needs a coherent cycle network with direct routes to encourage and support much more cycling to, in and out, and around the city centre and suburban centres, eg Hillsborough, Bradway, Darnall. The network needs to be clearly signed and properly cleaned and maintained; it would have a positive benefit to cost ratio.
</li><li><strong>
Safe cycling routes through parks and green spaces. </strong>CycleSheffield has given qualified support for the SCC&#39;s Green Routes strategy. Planning for the growth in cycling should take account of cycling to shops, work, rest or play, with routes that provide direct, lit, cleaned and maintained paved routes.
</li><li><strong>
Practical cycle awareness training for all drivers working for SCC andit&#39;s contractors. </strong>People are put off cycling by drivers&#39; behaviour. Sheffield Council should set the example for all businesses and enterprises in Sheffield by ensuring that all its drivers have practical cycle awareness training. It should ensure that all its contractors have this written in as part of their contracts. Veolia has this training for its drivers in London boroughs so why not here? Amey, the Streets Ahead contractor, should do the same. Developers should have it as part of their contractor&#39;s drivers training. 
</li></ul>
What can you do? Read the list. Discuss it with your friends, colleagues and family. If you&#39;ve got a demand you would like to add please get in touch with CycleSheffield which will finally agree demands at a meeting on Mon 3 Feb 2014
