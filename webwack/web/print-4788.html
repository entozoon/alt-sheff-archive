		<td>Permaculture is a holistic, theoretical and practical approach to designing our lives and the space around us. It involves integrating people into landscape in a way that meets their needs and at the same time allows them to put right any damage that has already been done to the landscape and to the local community. This weekend training event gives you a chance to learn more about the practice of permaculture design and to improve your design skills.
