		<td>Queer Tango welcomes everyone. It's a space to get together, enjoy tango music, to socialize, to exchange and learn. A continuous search for new ways of communication through movement and dance. Queer Tango breaks with regimented tradition and bends the rules that have, for decades, applied to traditional tango. In Queer Tango sexual orientation is not an assumption, and gender does not restrict you to a role. Queer tango is in favour of exploring and we embrace diversity. Queer tango does not discriminate against others or oneself. We respect codes, style, roles, type of dress and shoes, how the dancing couples are conformed, sexuality, religion, ethnic background, age, gender, nationality, social class... Queer Tango nurtures and grows from exploring the possibilities that - in fact - we get from all being different. Beginners always welcome! Participation fee: £10/£8 conc.
