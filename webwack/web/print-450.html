		<td>What are the long-term implications of "austerity" for our parks and green spaces? Who are the best custodians of parks and green spaces? And how does that happen in practice?

The many green spaces in Sheffield host activities organised by the council, third sector/charitable organisations, festival organisers, volunteer groups, sports clubs and members of the public. Speakers representing the private, public and voluntary sector will discuss this. The event will also be the launch of the Public Urban Green Space Group (PUGS) to bring together academics, policy-makers, practitioners, community groups and members of the public who are interested in parks and other public green spaces. It aims to develop and share ideas for making green spaces available for everyone to enjoy. This initiative is being driven by Sheffield Institute for Policy Studies (at Sheffield Hallam University), The University of Sheffield and Sheffield City Council.

Event led by Jill Dickinson and Will Eadson (Sheffield Hallam University) and Nicola Dempsey (University of Sheffield). Part of Understanding Society, the festival of social sciences, organised by the universities (Sheffield and Hallam), funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. Free to attend, pre-booking a place is recommended.
