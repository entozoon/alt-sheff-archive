		<td>When it comes to money, Laurence Peacock (BA English Lit, 2008) definitely knows what he’s talking about. OK, fine, he really doesn’t. But he’s tried his best to find out ... From the mind that brought you ironic tax advice (Dodge&Co, Festival of Debate 2017/18) comes a show about money, and how profoundly weird it is. Join Laurence as he tries to answer the fundamental questions: What is money? Where does it come from? And will you give him £7 to talk about it for 50 minutes? No? What if he throws in some jokes and promises to keep the graphs to a minimum?

Part of Festival of Debate 2019. Booking at the link below.
