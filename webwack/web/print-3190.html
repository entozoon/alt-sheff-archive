Drug and alcohol support workers request your support in fighting cuts to drug treatment in Sheffield that the Drug and
Alcohol Coordination Team (DACT) plans to implement from April. These cuts involve a reduction of 10% each from vital projects run by CRI and Turning Point, and other services like Fitzwilliam Centre being left under-staffed. There has been a steady erosion of funding: one project alone lost 5 staff members two years ago and have not received an inflationary increase in funding since then. The savings are minimal - just Â£68K in one service, but will lead to job losses that includes losing specialist support in areas like Safeguarding Children.

Please circulate this in any trade union or activist networks you can, so that Unite drug workers get the support they need to beat these cuts. Join this demonstration, it would be great to have your support there, even during a lunch break.

Contact DACT (Sheffield City Council) to raise your concerns: <a href="mailto:Magda.Boo@sheffield.gcsx.gov.uk">Magda.Boo@sheffield.gcsx.gov.uk</a></td>
