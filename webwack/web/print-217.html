		<td>Extinction Rebellion Sheffield will line the roadsides near the railway station wearing masks, and inviting supporters and other people to engage in conversations about air pollution. This marks <strong>Clean Air Day</strong> with a call for the urgent needed to change the way we live. 

<a href="https://rebellion.earth/the-climate-factsheet-for-rebels">Time has almost run out</a> to address the ecological crisis; we face mass species extinction, severe climate change, and collapse of human societies and deaths on a large scale. Sheffieldâ€™s toxic nitrogen dioxide pollution on main roads is at environmental and health crisis levels, and this is due to due to the use of cars. Our lungs are being poisoned, children and adults are struggling to breathe. Peaceful civil disobedience is called for.
