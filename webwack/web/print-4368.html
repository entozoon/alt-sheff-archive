		<td>One of the most controversial Speakers of the House of Commons in recent years, Rt Hon John Bercow, will share stories about his life and career, giving a fascinating insight into the world of politics and the workings of Parliament.

John Bercow was elected as Speaker of the House of Commons in 2009. He was a Conservative MP before being elected Speaker, backed by many Labour MPs. His modernising tendencies, which include championing gay rights, mean he is sometimes a controversial figure among his own party.

Described as one of the Conservative Party's 'most outspoken social liberals' John first became involved in politics as a teenager, remaining politically active at university. He was elected as a Conservative councillor in 1986, has held various posts within the shadow cabinet and is currently MP for Buckingham. For many years he has run successful public speaking courses and has a long-standing interest in Burma, frequently raising issues of democracy and genocide in the country.
