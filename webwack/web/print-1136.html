		<td>If you want to find out more about a lifestyle completely free of any animal exploitation. Come and make friends, drink and eat vegan food. A different venue is chosen every month, which also means exploring vegan-friendly options around the city.   

This month it is a Bank Holiday picnic in Endcliffe Park - so bring a vegan dish to share (shop-bought stuff is fine) and a picnic blanket, a plate and cutlery. The cafe sells drinks and they have soya milk if you fancy a coffee.
