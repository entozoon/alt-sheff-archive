		<td>Public meeting with Mahmoud Sarsak, a talented midfielder for the Palestinian national football team whose career was destroyed by three years detention without charge or trial in an Israeli jail. His incarceration only ended in July 2012 after a three month hunger strike and an international outcry on his behalf by individuals and organisations including former French international and Manchester United star Eric Cantona, FIFA President Sepp Blatter and the international professional footballersâ€™ federation FIFPro. 

He is speaking as part of a campaign called "Kick Israeli Racism out of UEFA", event organised by Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign.</td>
