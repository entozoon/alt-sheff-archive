TAA exhibitions exist outside the corporate world and established art elites. Not funded by the Council, the government, or by business. There will be no divide between artists, organisers, and visitors, in an atmosphere where everyone attending will hopefully be an active participant. To build community, to build cultures of resistance, encouraging everyone to take positive personal action in all areas of our lives. <ul><li>Thurs 13th - Sat 15th May: open 12pm - midnight</li><li>Plus shows each evening from 7.30pm</li><li>1 Saville St. S4 7UD (Wicker Arches)</li><li>Photos and interviews at <a href="http://sheffield.indymedia.org.uk/2010/05/451200.html">Indymedia website</a></li></ul>Website: <a href="http://www.asksheffield.org/">www.asksheffield.org</a>
