An evening of hot food and drinks for all those who went on the demonstration, as well as friends and family and anyone else who is opposed to the UK detention system and hostile environment. 

A chance to get warm and dry, and chat to others about migrant solidarity in Sheffield. There will be hot drinks and snacks available from 5pm, and food served from 6pm (small suggested donation for each, or free to asylum seekers and refugees). All food will be vegan. The venue is wheelchair accessible, with an accessible toilet and baby changing facilities on site.
