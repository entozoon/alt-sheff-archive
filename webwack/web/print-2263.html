<strong>Be a Cycle Cash Bomb!</strong>

A cycle cash bomb is a social device that destroys the myths that retailers tell themselves about how important it is that car-driving customers can park outside their store. To make a cycle cash bomb you need a critical mass of willing people on bicycles, armed with sufficient cash, and some targets known as shops that are open, preferably near each other. Detonating a cycle cash bomb is thrilling and causes no danger to the cyclists.

Each cyclist carries slips of paper that state "I did my shopping by bike" (these may be decorated with slogans and may or may not have names). Assembling together carefully to ensure they get to a critical mass, the cyclists go and shop, pay in cash, tell the shop staff they are a "cycle cash bomb" and leave a slip with the retailer. Cyclists may all start in one go, or set off in clusters or individually on a cycling circuit. Some time later, they visit the targets and survey the effect on their business. A Sky Ride is ideal, so the first ever Sheffield cycle cash bomb will be at the Sky Ride on 10th August. For full details see the links below.
