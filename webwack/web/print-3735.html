		<td>Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. Talks are typically about a common belief that can be demonstrated to be false or cannot be justified by the available evidence. The events are free though they ask for a Â£2 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views.

This month, Angela Saini, academic, award winning journalist and writer and BBC science reporter, talks about her book Geek Nation, a fascinating story of how India, a nation of geeks, swots and nerds is transforming itself into a global science superpower.
