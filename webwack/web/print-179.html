		<td>Sheffield Stop and Scrap Universal Credit is supporting UNITE’s National Action Day against Universal Credit with this rally and protest. They will be handing out leaflets, asking passers-by to sign the petition and collecting for the Food Banks. Bring your banners!

As Unite Community’s head Liane Groves said, Universal Credit is causing misery and suffering as survey results clearly show. Hundreds of thousands of children in the UK are not being fed properly because their parents don’t have the money to make ends meet.
