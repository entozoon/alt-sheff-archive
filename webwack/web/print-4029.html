		<td>Activist meeting to coincide with the Sheffield Trades Council delegate meeting. The Trades Council will begin at 7pm with its normal business, then suspend standing orders at 8pm in order to convene a South Yorkshire-wide open activists meeting. This will be an organising meeting only, on how to build for the big demonstration march and rally on 30th November, to ensure an event that rattles Cameron and really builds up our strength at the base of the union where it matters. (Ben Morris, Sheffield NUT Joint Sec/VP Sheffield Trades Council)

Please make every effort to attend this meeting, and try to encourage every activist serious about building Nov 30th to attend. Copies of the Trades Council generic leaflet for the South Yorks march and rally will be available on the night.

Sheffield Anti Cuts Alliance is a grass roots working class anti cuts organisation bringing together trade unionists, campaigners, students, the unemployed, pensioners and disabled people against the cuts.
