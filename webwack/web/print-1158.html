		<td>Six artists from Yorkshire respond to the current conditions in the after-effects of Austerity Britain 2.0. Fighting For Crumbs (subtitled Art in the Shadow of Neoliberal Britain) was inspired by the film "Invisible Britain" (based on the work of Sleaford Mods) on overlooked UK towns and cities. It was also motivated by a request to contribute to the 50th anniversary celebrations of "The RedShed" (Wakefield Labour Club). The event is based in Sheffield and Wakefield and explores the position of art, and artists, in a period when we are all being pressured to strive for crumbs - a time when wages are low, and the market dictates creativity.
