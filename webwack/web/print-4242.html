		<td>Sheffield Uncut have done some great anti-cuts/anti-tax dodging actions over the last few months. They're currently planning the next action on Saturday 2nd July - a 'teach in' with the theme being the impact of the cuts on education. Meet at the City Hall steps at midday - location of action to be decided on the day. Bring pens, paper, leaflets, something to say, but most of all just yourself!

If you just want to hand out leaflets outside that's great - they're a friendly bunch interested in lovely peaceful protest and giving information to members of the public. 

Why are they doing this? Either the tax avoided and evaded in <b>one</b> single year, <b>or</b> the taxpayer subsidy to the banking industry could pay for all of the £81bn, four-year cuts programme. At the same time as making massive cuts to public services, this government is letting rich individuals and corporations avoid billions of pounds of tax. According to a HMRC estimate around £42 billion was avoided in 2008-2009. Many big companies use tax havens to avoid hundreds of millions in tax, including AstraZenaca, Barclays, Boots, Diego, Lloyds TSB, Shell, and Tesco. 

Check out the UKUncut website for more details..it would be great to see you there.
