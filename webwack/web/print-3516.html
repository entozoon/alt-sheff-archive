Hazelhurst Community Supported Agriculture Co-operative is now a thriving organisation. From its idyllic site in the Moss Valley since the end of July they have been supplying a weekly bag of fresh organic vegetables to 35 households in Sheffield, and more to local shops and restaurants. Maureen, a customer in Heeley, says: ‘The veg is really delicious. It’s picked the same day so it’s really fresh. And it only comes from 3 miles away!’ Come along and find out about growing organic fruit and vegetables with the help of the local community for the local community, in south Sheffield.

Everyone is welcome to attend the AGM, although only members can vote. Followed at 7.30pm by The Fun, Figures and Freedom of Community Food Initiatives, an illustrated discussion with Nick Weir of Stroud Community Agriculture and <a href="http://www.stroudco.org.uk/">Stroudco Food Hub</a>.

6pm drinks/snacks, 6.30pm AGM, 7.15pm refreshments break, 7.30pm talk by Nick Weir.
