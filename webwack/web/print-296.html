		<td>This carnival has run since 2004 (originally a celebration of the first anniversary of the end of the Iraq war) to bring peaceful protest to the streets of Sharrow. Today they keep to these morals by celebrating the creative community in Sharrow. The carnival takes place annually in April and there are free lantern making workshops in the weeks before it. The theme for this year is <strong>"Disco At The End Of The Universe"</strong>

Gather at Mount Pleasant Park, (Sharrow Lane, near London Road, S11 8AE)  at 7.30pm, setting off 8pm to parade for an hour and arrive at Sheffield General Cemetery (off Cemetery Road) at 9pm for food, dancing, music, fire spinning and more! Everyone is welcome, including children accompanied by adults, wrap up warm and bring torches.

Volunteer stewards, collectors and decorators are needed. See the website for details, and lantern-making workshops.
