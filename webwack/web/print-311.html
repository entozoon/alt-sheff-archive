		<td>Family friendly weekend for local communities working together to challenge the fracking threat. Fracking has restarted in UK and multiple sites in South Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire are under imminent threat from drilling. Now is the time to learn more about fracking, network with others fighting fracking and learn how we can best protect our countryside, community and the climate!

The Frack Free Festival will be full of workshops and skill-sharing sessions from normal people with extraordinary experience in campaigning against fracking, and dedicated trainers with years of experience. There will also be space for discussions, performances, action planning and opportunities to
learn what has been happening on the frontlines of frack free campaigning.

<strong>Saturday:</strong> The full schedule of workshops on the Saturday will be released nearer the time. Some of the workshops we have confirmed so far include:
- How to monitor noise levels and air and water quality
- Fracking and Health: the health risks of fracking
- The Rogues Gallery and Creativity of Protests
- The Frack Free KM8 Campaign: how we won and what we learnt
- and much more!

The will be a creative corner throughout the day to make costumes, banners, placards or bubbles! There will also be a kids area, so you can leave the little uns to play if you want to get really stuck into a workshop!

The Saturday evening there will be music and performances and a screening of the film "The Bentley Effect" (the story of the legendary campaign that saw fracking banned in New South Wales, Australia).

<strong>Sunday: </strong>There will be some more workshops and creative sessions in the morning before a family-friendly march through Harthill. It would be wonderful if different groups could bring their own banners so show how wide the resistance to fracking is and how we are all united!

<strong>Monday - FOSSIL FOOLS DAY </strong>events to be confirmed.

Veggies Catering Campaign of Nottingham will be providing wholesome food throughout the weekend on a donation basis. 

Organised by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SheffieldFrAcktion/">FrAcktion</a>, a Sheffield-based group fighting for an end to the fracking industry using creative direct action, organised skill shares and training.
