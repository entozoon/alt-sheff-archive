There are plenty of things worth celebrating such as strikes, victories against big business muscling in on public land and resisting the bailiffs. Parties we like; thieving parasites, on the other hand, we don't. So we'll take advantage of that bank holiday they've so generously given us and party like it's 1968. Come on down to Weston Park for a BBQ and Fun N' Games 

Strictly dinner dress. Any food/entertainment you can bring. Suggestions for activities/events email: <a href="mailto:thefargatespeaker@gmail.com">thefargatespeaker@gmail.com</a>
