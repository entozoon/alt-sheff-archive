		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Sheffield Socialist Choir are holding this workshop marking the centenary of Joe Hill’s execution and celebrating his legacy of great political songs. 

Joe Hill was a political activist, song-writer of the American labour movement and a key member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or The Wobblies) in the early twentieth century. A tireless fighter for workers’ rights, his songs have inspired and supported the struggles of working people across the world. One hundred years on, join them to learn songs of social justice, protest and solidarity. 

Workshop sessions will be led by Janet Wood, Music Director of Sheffield Socialist Choir and leaders from other political and community choirs across the UK. All songs will be learnt by ear and you don’t need to read music. You will be able to learn new pieces written and arranged specifically to mark the centenary of Joe Hill’s death and also revisit some previous songs written about or by Joe Hill. Choir members, groups and individuals are welcome. Hot and cold drinks will be provided but please bring food to share for lunch. 

Workshop fees £20, £15, £10 depending on income – you choose!
