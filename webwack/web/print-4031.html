		<td>Skeptics in the Pub get-togethers are relaxed and enjoyable evenings spent listening to a talk, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. Talks are typically about a common belief that can be demonstrated to be false or cannot be justified by the available evidence.

Dr Belinda Brooks-Gordon C.Psychol, PhD, Reader in Psychology and Social Policy at Birkbeck, University of London, discusses the reality of the sex industry in Britain today. How prevalent is trafficking? What is the point of the law on sex work? What does it aim to do, and does it work? What are the myths and stereotypes that surround sex work? She examines the evidence base, case studies, and policy to show how the law is working, and where it is not.

Free event, Â£2 donation requested, meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
