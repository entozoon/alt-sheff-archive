Hi alt sheff,

Unfortunately, Kathryn Ford has had to cancel her talk for us tomorrow due to personal reasons.

We hope to reschedule Kathryn for later in the year, but for now have to cancel the talk on Monday.

We shall therefore be back in February as below. 
===================================================


Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to a talk. This month, Kathryn Ford MSc on the notion facial appearance shows a person’s character. This idea dates back to the ancient Greeks and the practice of physiognomy was once considered scientific. ALthough long discredited, it still persists within folk psychology. In this talk Kathryn Ford will look at the modern face of physiognomy trying to answer questions such as; why do we judge people as soon as we see them? How accurate are these judgements? Does facial appearance affect how people are treated within the criminal justice system? Warning: This talk will involve some discussion of rape.

Free event, but £3 donation requested. Meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views.
