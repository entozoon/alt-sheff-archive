		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A 5-session course of 2-hour talks. Councils are struggling to make ends meet. How they make decisions is sometimes not clear. Local Councils can seem daunting and difficult to deal with yet are a huge part of our lives. This course will help you find out how your Council makes decisions and, importantly, will give you the basics on how to affect those decisions.

Run by Nigel Slack, a Sheffield citizen activist. No pre-reading or pre-course work is required. No skills or experience needed, this course is for beginners. Bring materials for note taking if you wish.

It runs on both days from 2pm. Organised by the WEA (Workers Educational Association), booking below.
