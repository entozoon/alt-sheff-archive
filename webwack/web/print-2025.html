		<td>CycleSheffield is for all kinds of cyclists; meetings include things like "Space for Cycling", and what should be said to Sheffield City Council about (lack of) progress in planning a strategic cycle network, and stuff. All welcome to come along, listen and say and your thoughts and opinions if you want to help the campaigns for cycling to be taken seriously as a means of transport, with the facilities it needs. 

Tea and coffee etc available. Meetings are usually followed by a social in the Brothers Arms, Well Road.
