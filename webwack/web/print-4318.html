		<td>Women in Black is a world-wide network of women committed to peace with justice and actively opposed to injustice, war, militarism and other forms of violence. As women experiencing these things in different ways in different regions of the world, they support each other's movements. An important focus is challenging the militarist policies of our own governments.

All women are welcome to join this vigil which is protesting against the renewal of  Trident nuclear weapons. There will be letters for people to sign asking their MP to sign Early Day Motion (EDM) 1477 Trident Submarine Proposals. This condemns Government plans to order the steel and other 'long-lead' items for the first new Trident replacement submarine before any formal decision is made by Parliament on whether to proceed with Trident renewal. The new Trident nuclear weapons system will cost over Â£76 billion.

With the UK facing its biggest financial crisis in decades, rather than cutting public services, which will also disproportionately affect women, this money could be better used to invest in the economy, the NHS  and education, providing jobs at a time of increasing unemployment.

Sheffield Women in Black holds a vigil on the 1st Saturday of every month at the War Memorial.
