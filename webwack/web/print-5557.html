		<td>Vestas have closed the UK's only wind turbine blade factories, on the Isle of Wight but workers who occupied the factory are still picketing. Leafletting at Sheffield train station from 4:30pm will be followed by this public meeting with Richard, a worker from the Vestas factory, and other workers from current disputes. All are welcome. Richard will hopefully be in Sheffield the following morning too to do solidarity work, so if you would like him to visit your workplace, college or union branch, or are able to help him get around, please contact Phil on 07810 824 223.
