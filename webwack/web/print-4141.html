		<td>Transition Sheffield is part of the growing Transition Town movement, tackling climate change and peak oil with practical hands-on solutions that work.

This evening will be for discussing questions and suggestions for Transition Sheffield representatives to present to Sheffield Council the following week. Do you have a question about climate change, peak oil and/or the economic growth agenda that you would like to ask Sheffield Council? Do you have ideas for how communities in Sheffield can progress towards a low carbon economy? Do you want to find out more about Transition in Sheffield and help shape its agenda? Come along and share your views and ideas.

Cafe Euro will be serving teas, coffees, soft drinks, beer and wine as well as a selection of cakes.
