		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. Their motto is: "We have nothing to lose but our chains!" (But bring locks and lights too, just in case). 

This time the theme is exploring abandoned streets and neighbourhoods, and the "edgelands" of modern urban "wildernesses" which come and go and make those scuzzy bits of town. Pub stops in Neepsend.
