		<th>Details</th>
		<td>An Extinction Rebellion workshop which will look at how movements can be divided when oppression goes unaddressed, offering practical tools to heal these divisions, which affect our relationships as activists. The workshop will address the importance of understanding the structural nature of oppressions (such as racism, sexism, classism, ableism, the oppression of young people), as well as doing personal healing work â€“ both of which are necessary if we are to work together effectively in a united movement.

Everyone welcome. Please arrive early for 2.30pm start. Entry to the workshop will close shortly after 2.30pm (because of the structure of the workshop and group work.) It will finish at 6.30pm. (Please note that the start time has changed from 1pm to 2.30pm.)
