		<td>A Skeptics in the Pub get-together; a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to a talk, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. Talks are typically about a common belief that can be demonstrated to be false or cannot be justified by the available evidence. 

This month, Michael Heap, clinical forensic psychologist, on What&#39;s Wrong with Hypnosis? No-one investigating hypnosis now seriously doubts that it is ‘a genuine phenomenon’. Yet there remains something seriously wrong with hypnosis, something that people in the field have always been very reluctant to confront. What the problem is will be revealed and discussed in this talk. Michael Heap has previously held part-time lectureships in psychology and clinical hypnosis at the University of Sheffield. He has written and edited several books on hypnosis. 

The events are free though they ask for a £3 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
