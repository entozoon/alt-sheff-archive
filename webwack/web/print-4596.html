The art and crafts on sale have been hand made from natural materials and brought to the UK to raise vital funds for the school. To see a video about the school (which welcomes enquiries and volunteers) see <a href="http://vimeo.com/groups/15753/videos/16430625">http://vimeo.com/groups/15753/videos/16430625</a></td>
