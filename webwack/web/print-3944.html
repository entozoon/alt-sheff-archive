		<td>International Students for Social Equality meeting, opposing the extradition of Richard O’Dwyer to USA on copyright infringement charges. If found guilty, the 23 year old Sheffield Hallam University computer science student faces 5-10 years  jail. Judge Quentin Purdy at Westminster Magistrates Court ruled that, despite breaking no British laws, he can be extradited to the US to face trial for merely running a website posting links to other sites where people could download copyrighted content, including movies and TV programmes. US authorities have since closed down his TVShack.net website, established 4 years ago. It did not host any files or breach existing UK copyright laws. Join in the discussion of attacks on vital democratic internet rights.
