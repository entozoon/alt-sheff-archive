		<td>New local groups have been set up to challenge the BNP across the city. Please come to the meetings to organise local activities. The BNP intends to stand 16 candidates in this year's local elections in Sheffield. They are also putting up one of their national leaders, Mark Collett, in the Brightside & Hillsborough constituency. He has been exposed by the Sheffield Star as a "Hitler admirer" (<a href="http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/Hitler-admirer39s-bid-to-be.6021680.jp">Click here for article</a>). It is vital that we encourage all those who oppose the BNP's fascism and racist poison to use their vote.  If the BNP is decisively defeated this year, it will make it impossible for them to use the 2010 elections to boost their prospects in next year's local elections. 

See <a href="http://www.sheffielduaf.org.uk/activities">UAF activities webpage</a> for details.
