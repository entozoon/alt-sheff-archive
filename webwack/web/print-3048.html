		<td><b>Sadly, the Peace in the Park festival has been postponed until June 2014. </b>This is due to the problems of fundraising in the current tough economic climate, central government cuts, the increased costs of living and declining incomes. This tough decision will be a disappointment for the city, but with your support Peace in the Park will be back!

<b>The next Peace in the Park festival is now planned for next year (June 14th 2014). </b>

All money already raised will go towards this 2014 festival. Read the full statement at: <a href="http://www.peaceinthepark.org.uk/">Peace in the Park website</a></td>
