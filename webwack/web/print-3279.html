		<td>Following a popular showing in November, a repeat of this one-hour film followed by discussion, organised by Sheffield WDM - the World Development Movement. The film shows a new food system as it is being constructed almost from scratch. Farmers are gaining access to land for the first time and working in co-operatives to break the country&#39;s reliance on imports. It&#39;s all part of a country-wide process towards "food sovereignty", driven both by communities and by the government, to improve social justice and sustainability. Food sovereignty is an ongoing WDM concern, alongside their campaign to stop bankers betting on and distorting global food prices, and WDM are very interested in the ways it may connect with the thriving local food-growing scene.

All welcome.
