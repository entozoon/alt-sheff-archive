		<td>A 2 day workshop engaging with our lived experiences of the class system. Following on from the suummer 2019 event: <a href="https://www.chavsolidarity.com/post/class-workshop-summer-2019">www.chavsolidarity.com/post/class-workshop-summer-2019</a>

Class helps shape all aspects of our lives, including how we organise in social justice movements. This two day workshop aims to deconstruct our classed experiences and the ways in which we reproduce the same class system we fight against, in order to create stronger, more egalitarian social justice movements.

Support the mobilisation of cross-class people working towards radical social change. Support a culture of mutual aid and accountability amongst individuals living and working in Sheffield and surrounding area.

This workshop aims to make space for poor and working class folks to centre and articulate their own experiences and knowledge, share with others. And to support middle class and owning class folks gain recognition and take responsibility for the psychological and material benefits of their class position. Space to talk and plan steps towards change, for taking action such as collectivising and redistributing financial resources.
