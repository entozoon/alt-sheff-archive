		<td>Mike Granville of Sheffield Humanist Society presents The Omega Course Part 2 - Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the pulpit. Non-believers are not always as familiar as they would like to be with the questions and answers about religion, from the basics about the existence of god(s) to the details of the Bible. This event will try to help you with some of the questions that perhaps have you a bit puzzled. 

Mike Granville will discuss some of the more common issues but you can also send in your own question in advance if you would like, email <a href="mailto:mikegranville@sheffieldhumanists.org.uk">mikegranville@sheffieldhumanists.org.uk</a>

Organised by the Sheffield Humanist Society.
