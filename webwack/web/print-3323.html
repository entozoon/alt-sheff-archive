		<td>South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG) meeting. SYMAAG unites refugee, asylum and migrant organisations with campaign groups and supporting individuals. It campaigns both for the rights of those seeking asylum and of those coming to work in this country. 

The main subject for discussion will be about Uighur refugees from north-west China. A Uighur refugee will speak about who the Uighur people are, and why they leave China to find safety. See the UK Uighur Association website for more information. Also an update on the ongoing campaign against G4S housing asylum seekers.
