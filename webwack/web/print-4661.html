		<td>This week Cinema Syndicate takes a critical look at mainstream television; examining the seemingly ever-present and highly popular reality TV shows.

Directed by Paul Poet the documentary follows the art project/television show of Christoph Schlingensief (previous underground filmmaker, film & theatre director, actor, artist and author) which he contributed to the Vienna's 2000 international festival of culture.

The project, styled as a mockery of popular TV programme format Big Brother was critically aimed both at certain forms of television entertainment and at a latent xenophobia still thriving in the whole world.
