Global Justice Now (formerly World Development Movement) aims to change the actions, policies and institutions of governments, corporations and wealthy minorities, which are preventing an end to poverty and injustice. Part of a global movement, it works alongside people protesting in the developing world. Meetings are usually followed by informal gathering in a nearby pub.
