		<td>Public meeting open to all, organised by the Sheffield Cuba Solidarity Campaign. The Cuban Ambassador Esther Armenteros will address the meeting and discuss the illegal US blockade against her country. This blockade has undermined Cuban sovereignity and has been overwhelmingly condemned by the United Nations.

Esther will also explain the situation of the Five Cubans known as the Miami Five who were imprisoned in the US fourteen years ago. Since then they have won the support of human rights, legal and religious organisations, but have received scant justice from the US legal system.
