		<td>Join a monthly cycle ride in celebration of the bicycle as the most efficient, peaceful and perfect mode of transport.

Bring someone you know who's got a bike; bring EVERYONE you know who's got a bike. There are no organisers, no leaders; make some flyers and go around Sheffield sticking them on bikes or giving them to cyclists; speak to the person next to you at the traffic lights and tell them about it; do whatever you think will make more people come; come YOURSELF.  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2341924308">Critical Mass Sheffield Facebook</a></td>
