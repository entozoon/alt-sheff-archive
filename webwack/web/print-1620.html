		<td>The renowned Malawian writer, Jack Mapanje, was imprisoned without trial in 1987 for his radical poetry. Amnesty International campaigned for his release as a prisoner of conscience. Kachi Ozumba, author of The Shadow of a Smile, discusses Mapanjeâ€™s prison memoir, African human rights and other incarceration literatures. 

Kachi was shortlisted for the Royal Society of Literature Ondaatje Prize for a distinguished work of fiction, non-fiction or poetry, evoking the spirit of a place. Also shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers Prize, and featured among The Observer Books of the Year 2009.

Followed by Sheffield branch of Amnesty International meeting (monthly on the 2nd Wed of every month, newcomers welcome.)
