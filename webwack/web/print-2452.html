		<td>Monthly talk by the Sheffield Group of Positive Money. Mike Black looks at some basics of the money system in the UK. What is the so-called &#39;money&#39; in your bank account? And why do banks themselves deal in a special type of &#39;money&#39; that the rest of us don&#39;t use?

If you are relatively new to monetary reform, or struggling to understand how 97% of money is created by private banks, this is a good place to start. Positive Money is a movement to democratise money and banking so that it works for society, not against it. Mike has been a supporter of monetary reform for many years, and long before Positive Money started he was a member of the Bromsgrove Group out of which the James Gibb Stuart Trust was formed. He also helped to formulate the Positive Money draft legislation.

Refreshments available from 7.15 - 50p, and they ask for a donation of Â£3 to cover costs.
