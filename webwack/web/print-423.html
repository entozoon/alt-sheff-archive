		<td>"A Ã®nceput ploaia" (It started raining) is a film made to inspire debate and solidarity for the right to housing worldwide. Join director Michele Lancione as he presents the film. Roma people in Romania are often forcefully evicted. This documentary tells the history and reasons behind the harassment and the story of one community in Bucharest, and the longest and most visible protest for housing rights there. 

Free, donations welcome to FCDL (Frontul Comun pentru Dreptul la Locuire), a grassroots feminist anti-racist group that Michele works with in Bucharest. Vegan Korean food and beer also for sale.
