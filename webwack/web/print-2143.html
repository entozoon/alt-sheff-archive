		<td>The Dirty Coal tour is coming to the Northern Coal areas. Two Colombian community activists are travelling the UK to raise awareness of the impacts that their communities face at the hands of <strong>BHP Billiton</strong>, owners of the massive Cerejón mine. Come along to hear about the struggles in Colombia and Indonesia because of our addiction to fossil fuels, what you can do to help, and about opposition to opencast mining here. 

An Indonesian community activist will be talking about BHP Billiton planning a series of massive opencast coal mines in the rainforests of Central Kalimantan in Indonesia. This would destroy some of the last pockets of primary rainforest on the island of Borneo, deprive indigenous peoples of their livelihoods and pollute water sources relied on by up to a million people. The <strong>IndoMet project</strong>, BHP Billiton’s coal mining concessions span an area more than twice the size of Greater London.

BHP Billiton is the biggest mining company in the world, listed on the London Stock Exchange, so lots of people in Britain automatically invest in it without even knowing it, through their banks, insurance companies or pension funds. It has massive opencast coal operations in Australia, Colombia, South Africa and the USA and wants to begin a new opencast coal mine in the middle of the tropical rainforest in Kalimantan (Borneo) in Indonesia. It also produces oil and gas and is planning a massive expansion of fracking in the USA. It holds its London Annual General Meeting on 23rd October. Representatives of communities displaced by the company’s operations in Colombia will attend the AGM to demand justice.

This event is being jointly hosted by <a href="http://coalaction.org.uk/">Coal Action Network</a>, with <a href="http://www.peopleandplanet.org/">People and Planet</a> and <a href="http://www.sheffieldclimatealliance.net/">Sheffield Climate Alliance</a>. 
The Colombian visitors will be speaking at venues around Britain the week after the AGM.
