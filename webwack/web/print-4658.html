		<td>All are welcome to the (brief) AGM which will be followed by a talk by Stuart Parkinson, executive director Scientists for Global Responsibility, 'Arms Conversion for a Low Carbon Economy'. Arms conversion is a particularly pertinent topic given the current controversy about whether the Trident nuclear weapons renewal programme should be cancelled and concern about whether this would put people out of work.
