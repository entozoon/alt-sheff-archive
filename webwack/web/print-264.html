		<td>There was a social contract developed at the end of World War 2: work hard and contribute to society, then society will take care of you. That contract died when Thatcher broke the minersâ€™ strike in 1984-85. Economic decline over decades has led to the rise of humiliating zero-hour contracts with one-step-above-poverty wages. This meeting identifies the consequences and what can be done to change the situation.
