		<td>With wildfires still raging in Australia, Indonesia still under flood water and the next COP Climate Change Summit on our doorstep in Glasgow this November, now it is more critical than ever for us to organise effectively and take action. At this crucial time for the Climate Movement both nationally and internationally, Sheffield Climate Alliance will be setting broad priorities for the next 12 months of campaigning. 

This meeting will also be a special general meeting to vote on Sheffield Campaign Against Climate Change (SCACC) becoming a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO).
 
It will be fantastic to have as many members of Sheffield Climate Alliance in these important conversations, so please come along and have your say!
