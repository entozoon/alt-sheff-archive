		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A march and rally against job losses, hosted by Sheffield Trades Council on behalf of PCS to raise awareness about the loss of Civil Service jobs. Sheffield City Council and other "Northern Powerhouse" local authorities have been devastated by spending cuts. Poverty wages and insecure zero hours contracts are becoming the norm. SCA will join this rally to say climate jobs are the real alternative - and we want a renewable powerhouse here!

Mark Serwotka, PCS General Secretary will be speaking.

Assemble Devonshire Green 12 noon for the march and rally outside City Hall at 1pm.</td>
