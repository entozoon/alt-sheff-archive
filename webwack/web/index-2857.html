	<p class="message">Hazelhurst Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) annual general meeting, which includes a resolution to partly change the way that the CSA operates, as well as election of the committee. Hazelhurst CSA is now into its second main growing year and has managed to produce abundant harvests and had the pleasure of working with many volunteers. In keeping with its aims, the CSA has enabled many people to access fresh local organic food and is supplying the Gleadless Valley Foodbank with excess produce this season. The Management Committee feels however that there are two substantive threats to the future success of the CSA.The first threat is the financial viability of the Co-op, both in the medium and short-term, struggling to break even and probably making a loss this year. This is primarily due to the difficulty of maintaining enough Veg Bag customers but isalso partly due to very late crops. The other barrier to success is the lack of people prepared to take on managing roles within the CSA. Under the current CSA structure, these roles demand a large and regular time-commitment and so this lack of enthusiasm is perhaps understandable. There are many key roles that are currently not filled and this makes the CSA unsustainable in terms of people capacity.As a result of these obstacles, the Management Committee are proposing not to renew the contract to employ our grower that ends in Jan 2014. They propose instead to purchase produce from Huw Evans and Martin Bradshaw, two of the other independent growers forming part of <a href="http://www.sheffieldorganicgrowers.co.uk/">Sheffield Organic Growers (SOGs)</a> which occupies the same field that Hazelhurst currently rents part of. Some of the bought-in veg for the Veg Bags already comes from these on-site growers. Huw and Martin will hopefully speak about SOGs at the AGM. They are keen to allow the co-op to maintain interests in outreach initiatives. It would to continue to offer volunteers opportunities to get involved with land-based projects and to keep the connection with the land, and would employ a Veg Bag Co-ordinator. Making these decisions has of course been difficult but the Management Committee feels this is the only viable option to ensure the CSA continues to operate in the longer term. Please come to the AGM to hear more about the proposal. Elections of the Management Committee will also take place at the AGM. The posts currently up for election are Treasurer and Financial Planner but they would welcome anyone who wishes to join the Management Committee without portfolio (without a specific role).<a href="http://hazelhurst.coop/">Hazelhurst website</a></p>
