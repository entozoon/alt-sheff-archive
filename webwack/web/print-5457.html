		<td><img style="float:right; margin-left:4px;" src="afgha.html">The <a href="http://intsse.com/"><b>International Students for Social Equality</b></a> proposes a new and <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/sep2009/pers-s04.shtml">socialist movement</a> against war. Come and discuss this strategy at <a href="http://intsse.com/node/187">our meeting</a>.

The ISSE will explain why the war is being fought and its historical origins.

Britain is to dispatch an additional 500 troops to Afghanistan. The war has already claimed the lives of almost 1,400 coalition forces and Afghans numbering in the multiple thousands. This imperialist war of conquest must end, but how can this be done given the abject failure of the anti-war movement?
