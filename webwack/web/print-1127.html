		<td>Democracy Outside is participatory street theatre where people come together to have real conversations about the real issues that matter, in a public space. No justice no peace? No rights without responsibilities? Is a socially just society AND environmental sustainability just a pipedream?

It was previously toured in Leeds, Bristol, Oxford, Manchester at Hazard Arts, Hebden Bridge and Brighton. For more details call 07761 702156. Free, all welcome.
