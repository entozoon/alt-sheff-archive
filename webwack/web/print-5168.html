		<td>East End Quality of Life Initiative and the Handsworth Community Forum are mounting a Community Protest against the planned expansion of the Handsworth-based Asda Superstore, which includes 80 extra car park spaces. Say no to extra traffic, worse air quality, more CO2 and the destruction of local shops - join the protest at the bus stop outside Asda.
