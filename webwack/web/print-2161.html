		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. This time: Poetry, to coincide with Sheffield literary festival, Off the Shelf. Sheffield has poems on display, statues of poets, and locations and artefacts of Sheffield have been either settings or inspirations for poems. Ride to these places and look at things, recite some poems and even do a ‘brass’ rubbing of a hymn scratched, in the past, onto a wall.
