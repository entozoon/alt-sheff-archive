		<td>Sheffield council Scrutiny Meeting (10am) and Cabinet Meeting (2pm) today will debate very controversial cuts to Early Years Services. These meetings are open to the public, and questions can be asked. An acceptance of the cuts seems possible, despite public pressure during the consultation, and a huge petition. There will be protests, full details to be confirmed as soon as available.</td>
