		<td>Positive Money is a movement to democratise money and banking so that it works for society and not against it. The Sheffield group of supporters are putting on a series of monthly talks, the last Monday of each month at the Quaker Meeting House.

The talk on 31st March is by John Singleton, Professor of Economic and Business History at Sheffield Hallam University. His most recent book is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Central-Banking-Twentieth-Century-Singleton/dp/0521899095">"Central Banking in the Twentieth Century"</a>, published by Cambridge University Press in 2011. His talk will explain the origins of the Bank of England and outline its various functions in the economy. The talk will also discuss how the role of the Bank of England would change under the Positive Money proposals for reforming the monetary system.

Refreshments (50p) from 7.15pm, meeting from 7.30-9pm, and they ask for a voluntary donation (suggested Â£3) to cover costs
