		<td>Transition Chesterfield will be holding its 4th annual Potato Day, to encourage people to grow their own food, beginners welcome. 

There will be seed potatoes at 12p each (no minimum purchase quantities), 44 different varieties. Also onion sets, garlic, and shallots. Any surplus potatoes are distributed to local schools, and funds raised go towards other Transition projects, such as planting fruit trees in public parks and supporting Chesterfield in Bloom. 

It is possible to pre-order your potatoes, using a form that is downloadable from the website below. For hard copies to pass around to your friends, please email: <a href="mailto:food@transitionchesterfield.org.uk">food@transitionchesterfield.org.uk</a>. Pre-orders must be in before 10th December, and get a discount of around 20%. Pre-ordering also gives you a better chance of getting the varieties and quantities you want. Last year it was very crowded at the event, which sold out in less than two hours.
