		<td>Every year, the third Sunday of November is the  World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. This day focuses on both the overall scale and the individual devastation caused by road deaths and injuries and the impact upon families and communities around the world. Almost 4,000 people are killed and many hundreds of thousands injured on roads throughout the world every day.  Many more have to cope with bereavement or the effects of injury and thus become part of the huge group of people affected by road carnage.
