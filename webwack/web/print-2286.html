		<td>Fix and reuse, don&#39;t throw it away! Repair Cafe is a regular workshop event hosted by Repair Sheffield. Broken small household items? (toasters, shoes, clocks, weighing scales, etc.) Bring them along and the volunteer fixers will have a go at mending them. This isn&#39;t just a fixing service though, they&#39;ll show you how to mend it for yourself and pass on valuable knowledge on how to do things for yourself - including getting repairs done with confidence of what&#39;s wrong. 

There is no charge but if an item is successfully fixed a small donation towards costs would be welcome. All the fixers are volunteers and the project is unfunded. Contact for more information at <a href="mailto:info@repairsheffield.org">info@repairsheffield.org</a>
