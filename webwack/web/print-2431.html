		<td>The English Defence League are coming to Rotherham, and anti-fascists from Rotherham and Sheffield will be there to oppose them. For updates on the demo and anti-fascism in South Yorkshire, you can follow on Twitter @SheffieldAFN or email <a href="mailto:sheffieldafn@riseup.net">sheffieldafn@riseup.net</a>

The EDL will talk about sensitive issues like child grooming or the murder of Lee Rigby to try and drum up support. But they don’t have any real answers to the issues they talk about, or any suggestions for how to make life better. They just want to come to town, wave their flags around and go home, leaving the rest of us to clean up the mess that they’ve made. When racists exploit sensitive issues to stir up tensions in our communities, it makes life harder for everyone.

Join the protest in the streets to let these racists know they’re not welcome round here. Life in South Yorkshire isn’t perfect, but better to work with all our neighbours and workmates to make it better, not make things worse by letting racists set us against each other. We cannot rely on others to keep us safe from racists and fascists – it is up to us to organise together to defeat the far-right. They get their power from being able to mobilise on the streets, we must oppose them there and confront them in numbers. But effective anti-fascism needs all sorts of actions, from handing out leaflets to holding community meetings as well as turning out on demonstrations.
