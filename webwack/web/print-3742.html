		<td>A public meeting on the One Million Climate Jobs Campaign, coinciding with the visit to Sheffield of the National Climate Jobs Caravan. Two very different futures confront us at this moment - a continued push for fossil fuel extraction by powerful corporations, or a world of useful work to tackle climate change and bring security and wellbeing to all. The One Million Climate Jobs campaign puts forward a solution to the crisis of high unemployment and austerity. It enables us to move rapidly to renewable energy, well-insulated homes, cheap public transport, healthy local food and skills for useful work. Sheffield has already started to build a local movement of trade unionists, campaigners and faith groups to make this happen, and they want you to join and create a future that cares for climate, jobs and communities. 

Join in the dialogue about how to take these ideas forward. Speakers, discussion, questions and action planning<ul><li>Speakers:</li><li>John Stewart, chair of the Campaign against Climate Change and also an active member of the Campaign against Climate Change trade union group. He has been an environmental and transport campaigner for over 30 years, in recent years chairing the coalition that successfully opposed plans for a third runway at Heathrow. </li><li>Martin Mayer, chair of the Sheffield Anti-Cuts Alliance and President of Sheffield Trades Council.  As a member of Unite the Union Executive Council and the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) he works for public transport jobs and real solutions to climate change.</li></ul><a href="http://www.climate-change-jobs.org/">www.climate-change-jobs.org</a></td>
