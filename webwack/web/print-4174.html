		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The Health and Social Care Bill, containing measures which place the NHS severely at risk from competition and privatisation, returns to the House of Commons on 6th and 7th September before going to the Lords. The Bill has been amended, increasing the cost and bureaucracy of the reforms, but the basic dangers to the NHS remain pretty much untouched.

It is still possible to defeat this Bill if Liberal Democrats and the Opposition parties unite against it. Make your voice heard in support of the NHS and against creeping privatisation. Contact your MP urging them to vote against the Bill. 

Join the Sheffield Save Our NHS Vigil.
