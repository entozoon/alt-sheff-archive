	<description>March/April 2020 *** Extinction Rebellion is working hard to grow and become more diverse and massive. When coronavirus eases, we still face climate chaos. The recent budget yet again doesn’t properly tackle the eco-crisis. A promised national net-zero infrastructure plan was delayed at the last minute. The hypocrisy of taxing renewables remains, while fossil fuels and airlines are subsidised, and huge sums are ready for building new roads. Despite hosting the COP26 later this year, our government is setting a terrible example to the world by not taking its own carbon emission pledges seriously.Only ’people power’ will force the changes the planet needs. At the moment meetings and campaigns are continuing online. Fancy joining them? Contact XR Sheffield, or see the link below for newcomers.Extinction Rebellion - Join us</description>

With multiple projects and experiments always going on, the main aim is to bring people together around food. For years they have been part of the new emerging food economy, providing food and support to the public. Pay-as-you-feel arrangements apply to meals, workshops and events, and getting involved is more valued than whether you have any money. In normal times they open Wed, Thur and Fridays 10am-3pm, offering hot drinks, snacks and a communally prepared lunch for all at 12.30pm.  -&gt;  You don’t need a referral for Foodhall, unlike food banks,Foodhall isn’t a charity, it’s a mutual organisation (although it works with charities). It’s part of the National Food Service, campaigning to ensure this most basic need is met, in our fractured society.   -&gt;  During the crisis they aim to help the most at-risk, and isolated peopleand anyone who might not normally need essential support. Dozens of hot and cold food parcels are being taken daily to people in self isolation. There is a good interview on Sheffield Live! with Baillor Jalloh speaking to Foodhall’s Louis Pohl.   -&gt;  Foodhall’s current activities are:  -&gt;     Drop-off point for surplus food and important supplies  including toiletries, PPE, and other essentials: Full list of items needed here: (Google document)   -&gt;     Community kitchen  preparing meals, to be frozen, for collection  -&gt;     Pick-up point for food parcels collection (Wed, Thur, Friday 10am-2pm, address: Foodhall, 121 Eyre Street, S1 4QW)  -&gt;     Collecting donations to be redistributed (small team of trained volunteers)  -&gt;     Processing and delivering to our community and other at-risk groups (Mon-Friday 10am-4pm)  -&gt;     Coordinating with others (food surplus charities, community groups and mutual aid groups in Sheffield)  -&gt;  IMPORTANT: if you are able to donate anything, please arrive Wed, Thur, or Friday between 10am-2pm.

	<title>Universal Basic Income (UBI) Campaigning</title>
	<link>http://alt-sheff.org/stories/583/</link>
	<guid>http://alt-sheff.org/stories/#583/</guid>
	<description>March 2020 *** UBI Lab Sheffield is campaigning for the implementation of a Universal Basic Income (UBI). The organisation, which began in the 2016 Festival of Debate, now says UBI should be used as an emergency measure. With the proposed means-tested aid, some people will fall through the cracks, and Universal Credit won’t catch them. You can keep up to date on the UBI Lab Twitter account, and write to your MP to get them to sign this call to the Government to introduce a temporary universal basic income.UBI Lab Sheffield </description>

They share the costs of food, as well as maintenance costs and bills, and also share the work involved in running the co-op and caring for the house.Share Instead has a core aim of working towards a more peaceful, sustainable and fairer world. They want the co-op to be a place that supports activities which help to build such a world. The co-op is a member of Radical Routes secondary co-op, a network of trading and housing co-ops with similar values.If you are interested in joining the co-op, please email on shareinstead@gmail.com for more details and how to apply. The process takes a couple of months while they get to know you, and involves you coming to stay for a week.</description>

	<title>Extinction Rebellion halts Sheffield Council meeting</title>
	<link>http://alt-sheff.org/stories/577/</link>
	<guid>http://alt-sheff.org/stories/#577/</guid>
	<description>February 2020 *** On Wednesday 5th February, one year after Sheffield City Council declared a climate emergency, Extinction Rebellion Sheffield members disrupted the council meeting to demand action is taken about the climate crisis. Thirty members of the environmental campaign group stood in the gallery and chanted, sang and dropped banners that read “Time is running out”, “Climate action now” and “Citizens assembly now”. Some members also stood behind the Lord Mayor and the cabinet with a large banner saying “Tell Sheffield the climate truth!”The council chamber was cleared of most councillors and Extinction Rebellion Sheffield continued the protest outside, including a mass die-in. Councillors tweeted during the disruption.Previously the environmental campaign group has presented multiple questions and two petitions to the council, highlighting council inaction over the past year, not telling the climate truth to the citizens of Sheffield and failure to create a citizens assembly before the council’s own deadline of 31st December 2019. This last year of negligence puts Sheffield residents at further risk from the effects of the climate breakdown. Extinction Rebellion member Dr Bing Jones said, “Sheffield City Council is neglecting its duty. They have made no real effort to tell the people of Sheffield how risky it is to delay. The Tyndall Report that they commissioned requires massive CO2 emission cuts, now. They are ideally placed to initiate a wide and imaginative discussion but do nothing except delay.&quot; Extinction Rebellion Sheffield</description>
