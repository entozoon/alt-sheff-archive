		<td>Every year on 27 January, the world marks Holocaust Memorial Day (HMD). This has taken place in the UK since 2001. On this day we share the memory of the millions who have been murdered in the Holocaust and subsequent genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur, in order to challenge hatred and persecution in the UK today. The central vision of HMD is to learn from the past in order to create a safer, better future.

This year the theme is "The Power of Words"

Free event, everyone welcome on 25th January: 
12 noon to 4.30pm – Short films (drop in anytime)
5.30pm to 7pm – Memorial candlelit vigil with readings and reflections

In addition, from Monday 22nd to Monday 29th January there will be a collection of posters on display in the Winter Garden.
