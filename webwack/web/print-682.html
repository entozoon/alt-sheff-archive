		<td>George Lakey, anti-war activist, author and founder of the Training for Change nonviolence training collective has turned his attention to the economics of inequality, penning Viking Economics - billed as “perhaps the most fun economics book you’ve ever read”. He explores the inner workings of the Nordic economies that boast the world’s happiest, most productive workers, and explains how, if we can enact some of the changes the Scandinavians fought for surprisingly recently, we, too, can embrace equality in our economic policy.
