		<td>IPPR north and the Department of Politics at University of Sheffield invite you to a pre-election event to discuss why Britain is one of the most prosperous countries in the world, yet it is far from being a progressive or just society.

With David Blunkett MP, Kate Pickett, Department of Health Sciences at University of York and co-author of <i>The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better</i>, and Anastasia De Waal, Director of Family & Education at CIVITAS. 

This timely event, in the run up to the General Election will enable open discussion of how we can formulate policies which increase fairness and mobility in the labour market, give children the best start in life, tackle discrimination and unfairness while also supporting people to build assets throughout their lives. The event will consider why levels of poverty surpass those of our European neighbours, why inequalities of income, wealth and health remain stubbornly high and why parental social class, race and educational status still heavily influence life-chances. The discussion will explore <i>The Spirit Level's</i> analysis that almost every social problem common in developed societies - reduced life expectancy, child mortality, drugs, crime, homicide rates, mental illness and obesity - has a single root cause: inequality, and what the result of this is for society as a whole.

Places are limited. Please email <a href="mailto:north@ippr.org">north@ippr.org</a> to confirm or phone 0191 2339051</td>
