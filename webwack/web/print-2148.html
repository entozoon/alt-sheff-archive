		<td>Sheffield Climate Alliance and The People&#39;s Assembly of Sheffield and South Yorkshire are happy to bring you the real alternative to austerity and cuts! Having bailed out the bankers to the tune of Â£1.3 trillion, the government told us we had to make huge cuts in our public jobs and services to pay for it. But we need a massive investment in climate jobs to avert the threat of catastrophic climate change. The argument about climate jobs is closely tied to the argument about public spending cuts: if this planet was a bank it wouldn&#39;t be allowed to fail!

Speakers:

Martin Empson, author, long-standing socialist and environmental activist will be introducing the One Million Climate Jobs booklet.
Sam Browse: Chair of the Sheffield People&#39;s Assembly will link climate jobs to the fight against austerity.
Oliver Coppard, Labour prospective parliamentary candidate and Dearne Eco-Vision Champion on how to make climate jobs a reality.

Timetable:
Sheffield Climate Alliance AGM 6.15-7pm
One Million Climate Jobs 7-9pm
