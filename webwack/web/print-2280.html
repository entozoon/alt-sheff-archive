		<td>Positive Money is a movement to democratise money and banking so that it works for society and not against it. They believe that the power to create money should be taken from the private banks and returned to the people to whom it properly belongs. The Sheffield group of supporters hold monthly public meetings, the last Monday of each month, in the Quaker Meeting House.

This month a talk is given by supporter Steve Bollom. A chance for open discussion with some video clips and slides, looking at Positive Money as a campaign, past and present. It will focus on developments in 2014, including recent statements by leading figures in the world of finance that have been seen as supportive, and ask: What does the future hold for monetary reform?

Refreshments (50p) from 7.15pm, talk starts at 7.30. Donation of Â£3 per head requested to cover costs.
