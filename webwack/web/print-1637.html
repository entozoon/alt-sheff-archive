		<td>A Skeptics in the Pub get-together; talks are typically about a common belief that can be demonstrated to be false or cannot be justified by the available evidence. This month Tom Stafford asks are we irrational creatures, swayed by emotion and entrenched biases? Modern psychology and neuroscience are often reported as showing that we can't overcome our prejudices and selfish motivations. Challenging this view, cognitive scientist Tom Stafford looks at the actual evidence. Re-analysing classic experiments on persuasion, as well as summarising more recent research into how arguments change minds, he shows why persuasion by reason alone can be a powerful force.

These events are free though they ask for a Â£3 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
