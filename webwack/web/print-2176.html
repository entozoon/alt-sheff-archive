		<td>Sheffield City Council purchased Meersbrook Hall and grounds in 1895 to create a public park. Now there is doubt about whether funding cuts forecast closure of the pavilion and a wide range of activities. ‘Friends of Meersbrook Hall and the Pavilion’ was established in June this year in response to growing concerns. 

This meeting is to raise awareness and collect ideas and opinions from a wide cross section of the community, in preparation for the Sheffield City Council public consultation.
