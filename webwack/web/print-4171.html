		<td>Something for the end of your summer of sanctuary - a reminder of people still fighting to find this in Africa. ASSIST Sheffield is proud to host the film 'Getting Out', which highlights the struggle of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals in East Africa and their problems seeking safety.

Entrance is free! And there is free tea, coffee and biscuits. The film will start just after 7 pm and last just over an hour, followed by a discussion with LGBT activists about the issues raised. 

More about the film:

Getting Out explores the reality that for many LGBT Africans coming out to family and friends at home is not even an option. Before they can come out, they first have to get out. This means not only finding means to escape the political forces promoting homophobia at home, but also dealing with the hypocrisies and failings of asylum systems around the world. Filmed in Uganda, South Africa, Geneva and London, with supporting footage from Malawi and Zimbabwe, Getting Out depicts the true stories of five individuals navigating their way through this complex issue. The 60-minute documentary was produced by the Refugee Law Project in collaboration with the Ugandan Civil Society Coalition on Human Rights and Constitutional Law.
  
This issue is a live one still. Uganda's anti-homosexuality bill was pushed off the parliamentary table but there is still grassroots support and the dangers to activists are real, as shown by the murder of gay rights activist David Kato in January.
