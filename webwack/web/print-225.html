Global Justice Sheffield is a democratic social justice organisation working as part of a global movement to challenge the powerful and create a more just and equal world. We mobilise people in the UK for change, and act in solidarity with those fighting injustice, particularly in the global south. The Sheffield group is part of a global movement to end poverty and injustice, together with 60 other local groups and national Global Justice Now.
