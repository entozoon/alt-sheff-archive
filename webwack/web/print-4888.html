Edward Carpenter: a walk with Sally Goldsmith and Rony Robinson to hear about this Victorian writer, anarcho-socialist, sandal wearer and simple-lifer who lived openly with his male lover at Millthorpe near Sheffield and Chesterfield. This is a walk around some of the places associated with Carpenter and his circle, especially Millthorpe where he entertained many of the prominent writers and thinkers of his day including E M Forster, George Bernard Shaw and Olive Schreiner. We will eat our packed lunch in the garden of Carpenter House. 

Approx 5 miles with stops along the way. Meet 11am at Holmesfield Church carpark (on right, next to Angel pub). 
Fee for each walk is Â£5. Book as early as possible please as they are likely to fill up quickly. Expect wet and roughish walking and gradients, bring strong walking boots, packed lunch, drink and snacks. NO DOGS PLEASE. Share cars where possible. Let me them know if you can give someone a lift please.
