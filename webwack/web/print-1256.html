		<td>Just what is the cost of our digital dependency? Director Sue Williams debunks the notion that electronics is a ’clean’ industry by investigating a number of environmental and health catastrophes wrought by production of our gadgets. From early poisonous practises in Silicon Valley, to China’s ongoing dumping of chemicals, this is a story that isn’t being told – but can no longer be ignored.
