		<td>It’s LGBTQ History Month so to celebrate this and protest Julie Burchill and Suzanne Moore’s recent verbal assault on trans women, LaDIYfest is holding a reading/discussion group about transphobia, transfeminism and the importance of building a more trans-inclusive feminist movement. (If you didn’t follow this verbal assault, see details at <a href="http://storify.com/leftytgirl/suzanne-moore-timeline-of-trans-misogynistic-twitt">storify.com</a>
