		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Sheffield University Political Economy Research Institute (SPERI) annual lecture will be given by George Monbiot, writer and journalist, known for his environmental and political activism. The lecture is entitled "The Pricing of Everything". In his lecture George will address what he sees as a growing attempt to reduce political decisions of all kinds to a narrow, financial cost-benefit analysis. He will discuss the threat that he thinks this poses to democracy, considering such issues as privatisation and commodification, payments for ecosystem services, biodiversity offsets and claims by some government departments to have identified the "true value" of nature and of time. He will explore the worrying ways by which core human values get shifted in the framing of political discourse.
