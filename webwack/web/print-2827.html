Speaker Andy Walker supported members of Transition Meanwood and Otley Community Energy Group to become expert installers of home insulation.  Founding director of <a href="http://www.sureinsulation.co.uk/">SURE Insulation</a>, a social enterprise providing high specification insulation solutions in older houses.

Also Charlie Baker of <a href="http://www.carbon.coop/">Carbon Co-op</a>, a community benefit society which enables householder members to achieve radical reductions in carbon emissions through whole house retrofit improvements. By looking at some of the technical and financial challenges faced, Charlie will discuss the advantages of taking a cooperative approach to such work.

Free public meeting jointly organised by Green Triangle & South Yorkshire Energy Centre. All welcome.  Donations for expenses. Capacity limited to 50, please come early.
