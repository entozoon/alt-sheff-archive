In 1936, Spain witnessed a short-lived but inspiring transformation of society when the anarchist unions of the CNT seized control of the factories and land and experimented with new ways of organising production and distribution of social goods, co-operation and challenging poverty and inequality. Drawing inspiration from the amazing times of the Spanish Social Revolution of 1936, sharing the beauty and relevance of those events and making links with what’s currently happening in Spain, “Libres” is a historical presentation which includes folk songs written and sung in those days, as well as those of the artist. 

Entry £3/£5, tickets available in advance from Harland Cafe or can be purchased on the door.
