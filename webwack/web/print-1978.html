		<td>A drama about the Miners&#39; Strike, by Red Ladder Theatre Company. Olive, Mary and Isabel are like any other sisters whose everyday squabbles became a background hum to the strike that forced them to question their lives, their relationships and their family ties. We’re Not Going Back tackles the resilience of working communities, the make-and-mend fabric of family and the power of sticking two fingers up to a government hell-bent on destruction.

This is the one and only performance in Sheffield. Tickets only £7 waged and £4 unwaged!
