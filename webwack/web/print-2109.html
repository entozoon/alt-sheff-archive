		<td>In the past decade or so, various places in Britain (and in many other countries) have experimented with issuing their own currencies. The Transitions Towns movement has been at the forefront of this movement, gaining a big boost when the BBC paired the introduction of the Lewes Pound with the collapse of Lehman Brothers (along the lines of World financial system in chaos; East Sussex has the answer).

A local currency encourages the localisation of spending (which strengthens the local economy), promotes civic pride, and builds community spirit. Is it time for a Sheffield Pound? A talk by Dr. Jonathan Warner, professor and tutor in Economics at Quest University Canada, near Vancouver, British Columbia. He is on Sabbatical in the UK this year.  
 
Positive Money is a UK-wide movement to democratise money and banking so that it works for society and not against it, they believe that the power to create money should be taken from the private banks and returned to the people to whom it properly belongs. The Sheffield group meet the last Monday in each month, except public holidays, and organize local events, screenings, presentations, talks and discussions with the aim to spread the word and help the campaign grow. They also provide an open and inclusive space for our supporters to meet like-minded people in a friendly environment and to debate the questions around the money system.

Refreshments (50p) from 7.15, talk starts at 7.30. A donation of Â£3 per head to cover costs is requested.
