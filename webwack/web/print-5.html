		<td><strong>SORRY THIS EVENT IS POSTPONED OR CANCELLED</strong>

Premiere of a collection of 20 short music films by The Waterlily Project, a grassroots, internationally collaborative, feminist hip-hop inspired, passion project. Themes of trauma and triumph are shared with gritty honesty and a tremendous sense of hope for a brighter future. Over 100 adults and children in 6 countries donated their time and talents to create the films; musicians, poets, singers, rappers, dancers, choreographers, athletes, visual artists, actors and non-actors.

The evening will begin with a live performance by guest DJ Wayne Sealey, and Sheffield’s beloved hip-hop duo InaVibe, a viewing of the collection, followed by a Q&A. 

Doors at 7pm, Show starts at 7.30pm. Tickets £8 advance, £10 at the door. 100% of proceeds from the door will be donated to the Sheffield Rape & Sexual Assault Centre. This event is 18+.
