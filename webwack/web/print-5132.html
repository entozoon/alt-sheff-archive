		<td>Planning for Sheffield's Bike Festival (on Sat 19th June 2010 on Devonshire Green) is just getting started, by a group of people called 'I Bike Sheffield', all keen cyclists organising on a voluntary basis. The group is committed an open and inclusive process. 

Cycling activities from bike polo to bike decoration competitions, live music, school displays and plenty of stalls should be there. As well as promoting cycling as a means of sustainable transport they welcome other sustainable and ethical organisations, but want interactive displays, things to do, competitions etc. rather than typical worthy but dull petition-signing stalls.

Everyone is welcome to get involved in this planning for this exciting event, the first-ever cycling festival in Sheffield.
