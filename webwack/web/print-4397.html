		<td>A massive demonstration in London against the Con-Dem government's plans (11am Victoria Embankment, march to Hyde Park). The TUC (Trades Union Congress) predict that this will be the biggest union event in decades. The anti-cutback movement points out that UK debt is no bigger than it has been in the past, and instead the cuts are really a right-wing attack on ordinary people's living conditions. 

Coaches to London will be leaving from most cities. From Sheffield try to book a place through your union first, if you are not in a union contact <a href="http://www.sheffieldanticuts.wordpress.com/">Sheffield Anti Cuts Alliance</a> by email <a href="mailto:sheffieldanticutscampaign@gmail">sheffieldanticutscampaign@gmail</a> or Sheffield Campaign Against Climate Change (SCACC) phone Sheff 2746362</td>
