		<td>ASSIST is thrilled to have the Beeline quartet playing mellow jazz classics in aid of ASSIST at the lovely real ale pub, the White Lion. The band includes Yo Tozer-Loft whose beautiful vocals have been heard in several great Sheffield bands. The last event she and her band put on was packed, so don&#39;t miss out. 

Entry free with donations to ASSIST, in aid of its 10th year helping asylum seekers in Sheffield.
