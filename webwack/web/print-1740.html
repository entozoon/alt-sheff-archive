		<td>6th July, the first anniversary of the terrible siege and assault and on Gaza, marks the start of a national wave of protest, a long term campaign to end the huge military links between the UK and Israel. Sheffield Palestine Solidary Campaign is inviting supporters to the drone-manufacturing Israeli-owned factory of Elbit Systems, in Shenstone, near Birmingham, along with groups and campaigners from across the UK. The demand is that the UK stops arming Israel, and that this factory&#39;s production is closed down. Join a day of creative action in solidarity with Palestine!
