		<td>Another chance to see this film about refugees from Burma coming to Sheffield, via Thai refugee camps. Join <a href="http://www.cityofsanctuary.com/">City of Sanctuary</a> for a sandwich lunch before the film, followed by discussion of reactions to the film (which will help them to produce a report for their website and other showings).

The event is FREE, but contributions please from anyone able to pay (will actually cost them about Â£9 per person). If possible, let them know if you're going by email to <a href="mailto:Dan@cityofsanctuary.org">Dan@cityofsanctuary.org</a></td>
