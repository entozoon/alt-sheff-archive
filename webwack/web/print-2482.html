		<td>Women are under-represented in writing and directing roles in the film industry. For all UK independent films released  between 2010 and 2012, just 11.4% of the directors and 16.1% of the writers were women. However, for the top 20 UK independent films over the same period, 18.2% of the directors and 37% of the writers were female. And for profitable UK independent films, 30% of the writers were female.

This is the time to push ahead for women writers. This workshop gives space to try out your screenplay ideas and gain  constructive feedback in a positive environment. Both experienced and new writers are welcome. By the end of the day you will have an outline and first draft for a short film and have made contact with other women in the region on the same journey.
