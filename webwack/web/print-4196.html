		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The last public meeting of Sheffield Save Our NHS on 21st July with Dr Clive Peedell generated various ideas for continuing and widening the campaign against local healthcare cuts and the Coalition's Health and Social Care Bill. Come along and help plan what to do next.

- The Coalition's Health and Social Care Bill returns to Parliament in September
- Cuts in local health services
- The first selection of community services will be put out to tender soon (consultation Sept - Oct)

There's a whole range of different things we can do - something to suit everyone who doesn't want to be steamrollered back into pre-1948.
