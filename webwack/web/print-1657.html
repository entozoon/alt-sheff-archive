		<td>A Canadian/Israeli and Palestinian film. Former West Bank settler Lia Tarachansky looks at Israeli collective amnesia of the fateful events of 1948 when the state of Israel was born and most of the Palestinians became refugees. She follows the transformation of Israeli veterans trying uncover their denial of the war that changed the region forever. Tarachansky then turns the camera on herself and travels back to her settlement where that historical erasure gave birth to a new generation, blind and isolated from its surroundings.

Followed by film-maker question and answer session.
