		<td>London-based <a href="https://corporatewatch.org/new-book-the-uk-border-regime/">Corporate Watch</a> present a meeting organised by South Yorkshire Migration And Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG), discussing a new book, "The UK Border Regime". It describes and analyses the UKâ€™s system of immigration controls. It looks at how it has developed through recent history, the different actors involved, and how people resist. The aim is to help understand the border regime, and ask how we can fight it effectively. 

Everyone welcome, come and discuss the book with one of the authors, and buy a copy (or download and read it free, as a <a href="https://corporatewatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/UK_border_regime.pdf">PDF here</a>).
