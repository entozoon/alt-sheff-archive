		<td>This masterclass is a great ‘taster’ or starting point for anyone looking at a career in journalism. The masterclass will be led by Sheffield Star columnist Colin Drury. Colin is a double-award winning columnist who has worked as a feature and leader writer for The Star, Sheffield for three years. In the last year, he has had articles published in The Times, The Guardian and The Independent, as well as FHM magazine and NME. 

Details of the session are as follows: A look at non-writing skills required to be a journalist (knowledge of law, shorthand, how to find stories, etc.); How to write news stories (and crucially how not to write them) – including four rules and six questions which should enable you to write as well as anyone; how to write reviews and opinion pieces; how to get your work published and paid for, and what to do next.

Cost £13.50 for Writing Yorkshire members, £18.00 for non-members. More details and to book:
