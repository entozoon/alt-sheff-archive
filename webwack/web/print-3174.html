		<td>14 out of 27 community libraries are facing closure as the council implements a Â£1.6m cut over the next two years. Come along to The Big Book event at Sheffield Central Library and be part of the action. Tell the government and the council why they have lost the plot, why you want libraries to stay open and run by paid, professional staff. 

Sheffield Council will be debating the future of libraries, so this protest comes before the consultation closes on Monday 8th. (Protest postponed from last week when the snow came down!)
