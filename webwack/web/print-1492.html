		<td>Every year on 27 January, the world marks Holocaust Memorial Day (HMD). This has taken place in the UK since 2001. On this day we share the memory of the millions who have been murdered in the Holocaust and subsequent genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur, in order to challenge hatred and persecution in the UK today. The central vision of HMD is to learn from the past in order to create a safer, better future.

This year the theme is "Don&#39;t Stand By". There will be a candlelit vigil  Wednesday 27 January 2016, 5.30pm to 7pm in the Winter Garden.

There will also be a selection of short films to view in the Winter Garden on the day â€“ drop in anytime between 12pm and 5pm.

There will also be an exhibition of posters in the Winter Garden from Monday 18 January to Wednesday 27 January.
