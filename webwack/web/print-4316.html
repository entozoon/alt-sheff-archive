		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A friendly book group based in Sheffield Central Library, reading books with social-political and environmental themes. This month they are reading 'The Spirit Level', see the <a href="http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/resources/publications">Equality Trust website publications section</a>.

The group has run out of reading material of interest in the library of which there are sufficient copies for the entire group, and purchasing new stock is not an option due to budget cuts. So the plan is either to buy copies of books, with library copies (if available) going to those who aren't in a position to buy, OR to read books available for free online.
