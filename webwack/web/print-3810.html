		<td>The focus for this Transition Cafe event will be the Sheffield Food Plan. Chris Shaw, Director of Health Improvement at Sheffield City Council, will describe how the Council is planning ahead, thinking about opportunities for the next plan. There will be open space for discussions on various themes relating to well-being and resilience, and Transition Sheffield expect that the outcomes will further inform the development of the next Sheffield Food Plan. 

In addition of course, this is an opportunity to meet or share news with people from across the city and beyond who have an interest in sustainability. All welcome.

The Harland Cafe (formerly Cafe Euro) is on John Street, off Bramall Lane. It will be serving a range of hot and cold drinks, beer and wine, and light snacks.
