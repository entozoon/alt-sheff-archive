		<td>Neighbouring Doncaster has its Pride event as an afternoon street festival in the civic square. Free entry, two stages, rainbow market and food stalls, followed by after-parties. A celebration of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT+) community in Doncaster, along with friends and family. Five decades since the Stonewall Riots and the start of the fight for gay rights, the celebration is of sacrifices and struggle, and remembering that anti-gays laws and violence still exist around the world.
