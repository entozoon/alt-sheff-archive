		<td>Since 1967, more than 14,000 Jerusalemites have lost their residency IDs and, as such, their right to live in their city of birth. Termed the "quiet deportation", Israel&#39;s creeping annexation is organised through a web of discriminatory policies - including ID revocation, the ban on family unification, and barriers to child registration. This presentation by Megan Driscoll will delve into these measures, examine their far-reaching consequences, and focus on what steps can be taken to pressure Israel to end its efforts at ethnic cleansing. 

A public meeting run by Sheffield Palestinian Solidarity Campaign.
