		<td>The Palestine Solidarity Campaign have been meeting outside the Town Hall in Sheffield for the past few weeks. The numbers attending have increased week on week, with people appalled at the ongoing slaughter of innocent people in the Gaza strip, not to mention the biased BBC coverage. 

This is part of the protest in many cities around the world. Please come and raise your voices against this invasion. The Palestinian people will not be broken, but they are suffering a terrible injustice. Please help to make this the biggest protest so far!
