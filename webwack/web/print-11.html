A rally to mark the time in 1976 when Israeli police shot and killed six Palestinian citizens of Israel as they were protesting the Israeli government’s expropriation of thousands of acres of Palestinian land. Since then, March 30th is commemorated as Land Day, an important event in the Palestinian collective narrative. 

The Great March of Return was launched in Gaza on March 30th 2018, as a powerful reminder to the world that Palestinian resistance to Israeli colonisation and sumud (steadfastness) will continue until the refugees’ right of return is recognized.
