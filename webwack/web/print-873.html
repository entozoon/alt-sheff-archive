		<td>Do you want to gain confidence in identifying trees and woodland plants? Interested to know about woodland habitats and how people have shaped them through history? Want to find out more about how volunteers are managing the woodland today? 

Join Sheffield Woodland Connections, a team of artists, ecologists and landscape architects, on a guided walk through Ecclesall Woods to discover the magic of the largest semi-natural woodland in South Yorkshire. This is an interactive project, they want to hear your questions, no matter how daft; to know your thoughts; and see any photos or drawings inspired by your visit. Please bring along cameras, pens and paper and they will help get you inspired. If you want to show your love for trees by learning how to survey them, bring along a fabric tape measure or piece of string marked with 20cm increments â€“ then you can contribute a lasting record to the archives.  

Together these personal impressions will contribute to the Woodland Trust Charter for Trees, Woods and People, a campaign that highlights the importance of UK woodlands. By empowering people with a deeper understanding of woodland ecology, future generations will help protect one of our most precious resources.

Maximum 25 people per walk. The walks will be a minimum of an hour and will stick to marked footpaths. Sensible footwear is essential, as paths are muddy. All welcome, but the walks are not aimed at young children, although older kids with a passion for learning about nature are encouraged. Sign up on the day at the stall outside the Woodland Discovery Centre or email <a href="mailto:franhalsall@googlemail.com">franhalsall@googlemail.com</a> to reserve your place.</td>
