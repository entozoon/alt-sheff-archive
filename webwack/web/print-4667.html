This Session: 
Fungi fun, Photography, Drawing and painting, Lino printing  

Each session is a different activity ranging from den building and bug hunting to arts and crafts projects and sports activities. The sessions, lasting between 2 and 2.5 hours, are open access and the young people are free to come and go as they please. Activities are outdoors so please wear suitable clothing and sensible shoes. Refreshments provided: juice and fruit in the sunshine and hot choc in the cold winter months.

Sheffield Wildlife Trust is not a child care provider and under 8’s are welcome to attend but must be accompanied and supervised by a parent or guardian. They have an Under 8’s activity box with treasure trails and bug hunting activities. 

You don’t need to book but if you are bringing a group please let them know so they can bring sufficient resources.
Got an idea for a session? Email and they'll try and include it in the planning. For more info call Sheff 2634335
