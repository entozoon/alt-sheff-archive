		<td>Sun City Girls were an experimental underground music trio from the United States founded in 1981. In their music they slammed Mossad, the CIA, totalitarianism, the Zionist entity and the Israeli occupation. The US’s reaction to this was to smear the band’s reputation and create obstacles on their artistic path.

After the death of percussionist Charles Gocher the band ceased, but now founder members, brothers Alan and Richard Bishop present a tribute to their legendary band Sun City Girls. The night will start with a 40 minute film of Charles Gocher's video experiments followed by two acoustic guitar duet sets, selected from the 27 year legacy of Sun City Girls.
