		<td>Hate Fracking? Join Earth First for an amazing week of skill-sharing, networking and fun aimed at making the anti-fracking movement (and others) as strong, dynamic and strategic as possible. Earth First! is based on principles of non-hierarchical organisation and direct action to stop the destruction of the Earth and its inhabitants. Full details on their website.

South Yorkshire is under licence to be fracked. If this goes ahead our water, soil and air is likely to be poisoned beyond repair, by this dangerous new experimental technique. The only answer is to get together and stop it from happening before it is too late.
