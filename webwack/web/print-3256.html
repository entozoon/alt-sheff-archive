		<td>At 2pm today the council meets to sets its "austerity" budget and cut Â£50 million from some of our most treasured services. Come and lobby outside the chamber and put pressure on councillors to vote against the cuts. We cannot afford to allow the councillors to put through these cuts without opposition. We need to ask individual councillors to vote No to the cuts and join the people of Sheffield in defending our services and protecting the most vulnerable in our city, and to stop supporting the Tory government agenda of cut cut cut.
