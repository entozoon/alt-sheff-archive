		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Drop in from midday to learn exactly what "money" and "worth" are, and make your own promissory notes, and be able to swap them with others who make their own on the day. Cameras, laptop and printers on hand so you will be leaving with a fist full of your hand-made notes singing as you step!

Bring your own ideas, and take inspiration from the current Macrocosm exhibition, by Cassie Limb, raising funds for Peace in the Park Festival.
