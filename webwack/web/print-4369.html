		<td>Inspired by the 2011 waves of student protests and activism, Sheffield Universal Education Collective was formed to provide a free, radical, open and democratic education space in the city, with sessions that critically think about the world around us and explore means to change it.

Why did the financial system collapse? Did greed really drive the banks towards making risky loans, and did governments fail to stop them? Jamie Gough and Hugh Radice argue,that this does not get to the heart of the matter: there is a crisis of the whole capitalist system, including industry and commerce as well as finance. Merely regulating the banks would therefore not cure the problem; we need much more radical solutions.
