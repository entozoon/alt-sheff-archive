		<td>Skeptics in the Pub get-togethers are about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic.

This month, Tony Prescott on Transhumanism, sometimes abbreviated as H+, a global movement than promotes the use of technology to transform the human condition by greatly enhancing our physical and psychological capabilities. One outcome could be effective immortality, for instance, by uploading our brains into computers. Singularitarianism, or S^, is a related movement defined by the idea that a technological singularity — the invention of an artificial superintelligence — could bring to an end of ten thousand years of human dominance on planet Earth.

This talk will consider some of the technological and psychological evidence that we are moving towards either a H+ or S^ future, and ask whether it is time to get worried. Tony is a Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience, at the University of Sheffield.

These events are free though they ask for a £3 donation, and the meetings are open to all.
