		<td>In 2013 an inquest found that Jimmy Mubenga was “unlawfully killed” while being “escorted” by G4S guards on a forced deportation flight to Angola in October 2010. On December 16th 2014 these G4S guards were found not guilty of manslaughter. It emerged that the judge had ruled as “inadmissible” evidence pointing to endemic racism within G4S. The fight against this unrestrained corporate giant continues.
