		<td>Skeptics in the Pub gets people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. Meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views.

This month, Peter Naish argues that consciousness is something of a 'bolt-on goodie' for the brain, which does most of its work before consciousness ever gets a look in. As a result, changes to how that hidden working takes place can lead to changes in conscious awareness. Two particular examples that will be described are hypnosis and false memory.

Peter Naish has degrees Physics and Chemistry, and Psychology. As well as working in academia he has carried out research for the Home Office and Ministry of Defence, and is an expert on false memory and hypnosis.
