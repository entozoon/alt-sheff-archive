		<td>The state the Pope's in: How does the Vatican keep getting away with it? The Vatican has a long history of abuse of its people and of its power. It covers up its own moral crimes. And yet popes have been welcomed and treated as celebrities. Is it time to say - ENOUGH? 

A talk open to the public, organised by the Sheffield Humanist Society, all welcome. University Arms is at Sheffield University tram stop. Also accessible by bus: 51 & 52 best; 94 & 95 close by.
