		<td>Performance by Wound Up Theatre. A story of social alienation, prejudice, radicalisation and the rock band Queen. Dean joined the Army, &#39;Danny&#39; joined the Islamic State. One from Leeds, the other from London. Brought together in a holding cell in Northern Iraq, as captive and volatile guard. Shortlisted for an Amnesty International Freedom of Expression Award, Bismillah! is a hilarious, heart-breaking and compassionate contribution to the vital discussion around the experiences of disenfranchised young people in modern Britain.

Tickets £10, £8 concessions.
