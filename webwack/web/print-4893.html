		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Voluntary Action Sheffield is interested in establishing a Voluntary and Community Sector (VCS) Assembly as a way of  improving communications and networking across the sector, strengthening the sector's voice and ability to influence and improve relationships with the public sector.

A consultant has now been appointed (Bill Freeman, Director of Consultancy services at NAVCA) to review existing partnership networks, find out what is working well in other places and look at appropriate models for Sheffield. This consultation event will gain the views of VCS organisations on the proposals. The sector's input is extremely valuable to this important development for the sector.

For more information or to book, contact Jane Anslow, Partnership Development Manager at VAS, Sheff 2536640 or email <a href="mailt0_j.anslow%40vas.org.html">j.anslow@vas.org.uk</a></td>
