A funny and fierce new film this week reaches Sheffield, described as "the feminist Pride". It tells the story of protest by the Womenâ€™s Liberation Movement in the 1970 "Miss World" TV show.

Film screening followed by Q & A with script-writer Gaby Chiappe, Jenny Fortune, and hopefully the director Philippa Lowthorpe.
