		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Refused asylum seekers are not allowed to work, to register themselves as homeless or to be placed in local authority night shelters. Many become destitute, struggling daily for food, accommodation and clothing. ASSIST works with asylum seekers in this situation. If you are interested in volunteering, come to one of their "drop in and check it out" sessions. Meet current volunteers, find out more about the different volunteering opportunities, chat about what might suit you and apply to be a volunteer with ASSIST. 

Visitors can arrive and leave at any time during each session, and there is a short presentation at 15 minutes past each hour. 

To find out more, contact Jenny on Sheff 2754960 or email <a href="mailto:volunteer@assistsheffield.org.uk">volunteer@assistsheffield.org.uk</a>. At Victoria Hall, use the entrance on Chapel Walk, opposite the back of Marks and Spencer.
