With multiple projects and experiments always going on, the main aim is to <i>bring people together</i> around food. For years they have been part of the new emerging food economy, providing food and support to the public. Pay-as-you-feel arrangements apply to meals, workshops and events, and getting involved is more valued than whether you have any money. In normal times they open Wed, Thur and Fridays 10am-3pm, offering hot drinks, snacks and a communally prepared lunch for all at 12.30pm.<br><strong>  ->  You don’t need a referral for Foodhall, unlike food banks,</strong>Foodhall isn’t a charity, it’s a mutual organisation (although it works with charities). It’s part of the <a href="https://www.nationalfoodservice.uk/">National Food Service</a>, campaigning to ensure this most <i>basic need</i> is met, in our fractured society. <br><strong>  ->  During the crisis they aim to help the most at-risk, and isolated people</strong>and anyone who might not normally need essential support. Dozens of hot and cold food parcels are being taken daily to people in self isolation. There is a <a href="https://web.sheffieldlive.org/tag/sheffield-foodhall-project/">good interview on Sheffield Live!</a> with Baillor Jalloh speaking to Foodhall’s Louis Pohl. <br><strong>  ->  Foodhall’s current activities are:</strong><br><strong>  ->     Drop-off point for surplus food and important supplies</strong>  including toiletries, PPE, and other essentials: Full list of items needed here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b93O68KPwEKIpzaMwpSO2TNckMi8JyIwYCFezp5He_M/edit">(Google document)</a> <br><strong>  ->     Community kitchen</strong>  preparing meals, to be frozen, for collection<br><strong>  ->     Pick-up point for food parcels collection</strong> (Wed, Thur, Friday 10am-2pm, <a href="https://www.foodhallproject.org/location">address</a>: Foodhall, 121 Eyre Street, S1 4QW)<br><strong>  ->     Collecting donations</strong> to be redistributed (small team of trained volunteers)<br><strong>  ->     Processing and delivering</strong> to our community and other at-risk groups (Mon-Friday 10am-4pm)<br><strong>  ->     Coordinating with others</strong> (food surplus charities, community groups and mutual aid groups in Sheffield)<br><strong>  ->  IMPORTANT: if you are able to donate anything, please arrive Wed, Thur, or Friday between 10am-2pm.

Nearly half a million people have signed up to volunteer, which is great. Remember this is a marathon not a sprint. We’re not at the peak yet, and help will be even more crucial in a few weeks’ time. <br>The simplest thing everyone can do right now is to look out for their neighbours; offer help with shopping and other errands if people cannot get out of the house. Also to consider if you are fit and able to help:<br>~ Medical staff and volunteers <br>~ Volunteers and staff in key worker roles<br>~ Supermarket staff  <br>~ Delivery drivers<br>~ Etc.<br><br><strong>Online finding volunteer work:</strong> <a href="https://do-it.org/opportunities/search">Do-it offers a website</a> to link up willing people with volunteering opportunities/needs. You can search within an area, or use "Advanced search" to find positions by name, skills, time available, etc. <br><br><strong>Local voluntary organisations</strong> are working together with the Council and other organisations to co-ordinate the work needed.

Enough to keep in touch, but not to let it depress you. The mainstream media seems to have started helping the nation’s mood, with more themes of humour, and “how to self-isolate and care for yourself”. Even Radio 4 has more comedy, amid its endless focus on negative things like disease, crime, and UK Conservative/capitalist politics. <br>To brighten up the mood, it’s best to switch on happy music, and dance! <br>Local radio is another life-line to the outside world; it can be comforting to know that the presenter is quite nearby.

Updates will be provided about market changes on the <a href="https://sheffieldmarkets.com/">Sheffield Markets website</a> and shared on the <a href="https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/">City Council’s website</a>.<br><br><strong>Delivery services:</strong><strong>There can be long delays and online problems in ordering</strong> from the big "mainstream" supermarkets, even for "priority" vulnerable/elderly customers. Instead, to find out which smaller shops are doing deliveries, look at your local group discussions (see NEIGHBOURHOODS above, under ② DELIVERY SERVICES & COMMUNITY SUPPORT GROUPS).<br><br><strong><a href="https://www.3miles.co.uk/">3miles.co.uk</a></strong>offers local groceries from certain local shops in Sheffield.

But online events are beginning to be organised, some featured here on the <a href="https://alt-sheff.org/">Alt-Sheff events listing</a>. If you know of any events in the Sheffield area, please email us.<br><br><strong>The 2020 Festival of Debate:</strong><br>The "FoD" is postponed but not cancelled. The organisers (Opus) say that even in a crisis we need to discuss how we can come together to make change.  Conversation, discussion and debate are more crucial than ever. So over the coming weeks they will be exploring how to deliver a revised programme of online events, and some events  will be held later in the year, hopefully. Anyone with tickets is asked to wait for a rearranged date, if possible. (Or email for a refund via Tickets For Good). This is a huge blow for Opus and the staff, so if you are able and would like to support, you can by joining the <a href="http://weareopus.org/projects/friends/?v=79cba1185463">‘Friends of Opus’</a>. And stay tuned for news, on the <a href="https://www.festivalofdebate.com/">Festival of Debate website</a> or social media channels.<br><br><strong>Household waste:</strong><br>Sheffield City Council hopes to resume <i>garden</i> waste collections from Monday 6th April 2020, depending on the availability of Collection Crews. Check their website for updates or see <strong><a href="https://www.veolia.co.uk/sheffield/service-alerts">Veolia’s Service Alerts website</a></strong>.<br><strong>Quote: "If your garden waste collection is scheduled for Monday 6 April please put your green bin out on the pavement before 7am."</strong><br>The Council asks us to note that we all should sanitise wheelie-bin handles, and only visit a waste disposal site if totally essential and unavoidable. Sites are open between 10am-4pm but visitors are having to patiently wait and spread out in long queues, due to social distancing guidelines.<br><br><br><br><strong>⑪   INFORMATION FOR EVENT & WORK ORGANISERS</strong><h5><i>There are people in Sheffield urgently working on <strong>running events online</strong>, video conferencing, etc. We will put information here about Free software and instructions, soon. Everyone organising will probably need to know this, so we can also publicise contacts. If you know anyone with skills or interest in this technical stuff please let us know, or pass this request to them.</i></h5><strong>Can anyone set themselves up as a volunteer group? </strong><br>Support groups can be set up by anyone, but note that forming an organisation includes legal responsibilities <i>by default</i>. This includes law on managing safeguarding, DBS (criminal record checks), references, etc. Most people just want to do the right thing, and we should not be too "risk-averse" that we <i>do not</i> look out for neighbours. But there are always people who exploit any situation, so we also need to be careful about our actions, both to protect vulnerable people, and to avoid being accused of doing wrong. Be very careful handling people’s money, or going into people’s home alone, for example. <br><strong>Advice is available</strong>, we suggest starting online at <a href="https://www.vas.org.uk/">Voluntary Action Sheffield</a>. Also the NCVO (National Council for Voluntary Organisations) also offers its <a href="https://knowhow.ncvo.org.uk/">KnowHow guidance</a> free for everyone to access.  <br><strong>On volunteer safety</strong>, consider reading <a href="https://knowhow.ncvo.org.uk/tools-resources/volunteers-and-the-law/insurance">Insurance and Volunteers</a>, and <a href=https://knowhow.ncvo.org.uk/tools-resources/volunteers-and-the-law/vulnerable-clients">Safeguarding and Vulnerable Clients</a>. <br><strong><a href="https://www.safechilduk.info/newsletters/online-safeguarding-training.html">SAFE</a></strong> offers expert services and online training including DBS (criminal record checks), policy creation and guidance, safeguarding, management briefings and incident support. It costs money, but profit is put back so voluntary organisations and charities can benefit for subsidised prices. They have trained thousands of staff and volunteers <br><strong>Remember, volunteers may have to stop</strong>, particularly over 70s or with high risk medical conditions. Please make sure you know <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-government-response">current government advice</a>, and try to plan this in. <br><strong>On the other hand, there may be willing volunteers</strong> if you’re planning something new, or having to increase your efforts, because some organisations have had to slow down, or even close. Maybe there are skilled people stuck at home, and willing to temporarily help. To contact any potential volunteers or partner organisations, <a href="https://www.vas.org.uk/">Voluntary Action Sheffield</a> would probably be the best people to ask.<br><strong>For running support work</strong> during the Coronavirus crisis, there is a useful, readable <a href="https://queercare.network/our-work/resources/covid-19/policy-for-doing-support-work-in-the-covid-19-pandemic/">Policy</a> and <a href="https://queercare.network/our-work/resources/covid-19/principles-and-assumptions-for-doing-support-work-in-the-covid-19-pandemic/">Principles</a>, produced by an organisation called QueerCare with the approval and oversight of qualified medical professionals, based on experience of such work. Some of it seems to repeat, but only because it is designed in sections to apply to different tasks. This can be seen in the <a href="https://wiki.queercare.network/index.php?title=Category:Covid">Index</a> which shows it covers various subjects including collecting items from someone who is potentially infected, Data Protection policy, and collecting prescriptions for others.<h5><i>Thanks to <a href="https://www.ncvo.org.uk/ncvo-volunteering/i-want-to-volunteer/volunteering-coronavirus">NCVO</a> and <a href="https://volunteeringmatters.org.uk/">Volunteering Matters</a> for some of the above information and suggestions.</i></h5><br><br><strong><a href="https://coronavirustechhandbook.com/">The Coronavirus Tech Handbook</a></strong>is a fantastic online resource for technical help. It’s a crowdsourced library for technologists, civic organisations, public and private institutions, researchers, and specialists of  kinds working on responses to the pandemic. It is a rapidly evolving resource with thousands of expert contributors.  It covers a huge range, under headings like Volunteering & Mutual Aid, Tools for Volunteering & Organising, Medicine & Healthcare and much more. Well recommended.

It’s run by a private US corporation for profit, so it’s not ’free’ software, but it is becoming widely used because it starts with a no-cost offer.There is plenty of online help, such as these short YouTube videos:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9guqRELB4dg">How to SET UP Zoom meetings</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkK5WEf6xgk">Breakout Rooms in Zoom</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i-NA563Ojk">Zoom Meetings including Breakout Rooms – 33 mins</a><br>And this Extinction Rebellion <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WVhQ5YE9Qu4eJBLDuTXJOxYTvNr-XUB94wwvc5J2tzY/">Google document</a> is another good guide<br><br><strong>Video Conferencing: Good advice</strong> <br>1.    Before the call, send out/read any documents that need to be shared. <br>2.  Close other apps/programs before starting, to avoid slowing your machine.<br>3.  Check your internet speed with a tool, like Speedtest.net. If low, move closer to the wi-fi router or connect by cable.<br>4.  Close confidential websites and emails etc., if you will be sharing your screen.<br>5.  Test the video and audio before you start; video conferencing tools usually have a test facility.<br>6.  Try to use headphones or earbuds, with cable; not Bluetooth or wireless, these can be slower.<br>7.  Try to use a lapel microphone, or position the mic close to your mouth, rather than using a built-in microphone.<br>8.  Arrange all your documents and notes to hand before starting. <br>9.  Sit in a bright place, ideally facing a sunny window.<br>10. Neutral backgrounds are best. You can blur your background on Skype, or have a virtual background on Zoom.<br>11. Position the camera at eye level. For a laptop with built-in camera, place it on something to raise it a little.<br>12. When talking, look straight into the camera, it looks less distracting .<br>13. Mute your own volume when not speaking, unmute only when you want to speak.<br>14. Pay attention when someone’s speaking, keep your eyes on the camera (it’s obvious of you don’t, it’s distracting).<br>15. Try to keep pets/kids away, but if interrupted, just politely excuse yourself briefly, people will understand.<br>(<i>Adapted, with thanks to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/663874/12-tips-for-video-conferencing-while-you-work-from-home/">Khamosh Pathak</a></i>)<br><br><strong>Loomio is a useful tool for group online discussion and decision making</strong>.

    <div class="message">Extinction Rebellion is working hard to grow and become more diverse and massive. When coronavirus eases, we still face climate chaos. The recent budget yet again doesn’t properly tackle the eco-crisis. A promised national net-zero infrastructure plan was delayed at the last minute. The hypocrisy of taxing renewables remains, while fossil fuels and airlines are subsidised, and huge sums are ready for building new roads. Despite hosting the COP26 later this year, our government is setting a terrible example to the world by not taking its own carbon emission pledges seriously.<br><br><strong>Only ’people power’ will force the changes the planet needs.</strong> At the moment meetings and campaigns are continuing online.

		<h4><a href="577.html">Extinction Rebellion halts Sheffield Council meeting</a></h4>
		<p class="info">February 2020</p>
    <div class="message">On Wednesday 5th February, one year after Sheffield City Council declared a climate emergency, Extinction Rebellion Sheffield members disrupted the council meeting to demand action is taken about the climate crisis. Thirty members of the environmental campaign group stood in the gallery and chanted, sang and dropped banners that read “Time is running out”, “Climate action now” and “Citizens assembly now”. Some members also stood behind the Lord Mayor and the cabinet with a large banner saying “Tell Sheffield the climate truth!”<br><br>The council chamber was cleared of most councillors and Extinction Rebellion Sheffield continued the protest outside, including a mass die-in. Councillors <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/shaffaqmohd/status/1225091516084953088?s=04">tweeted during the disruption</a>.<br><br>Previously the environmental campaign group has presented multiple questions and two petitions to the council, highlighting council inaction over the past year, not telling the climate truth to the citizens of Sheffield and <strong>failure to create a citizens assembly before the council’s own deadline of 31st December 2019.</strong> This last year of negligence puts Sheffield residents at further risk from the effects of the climate breakdown. <br><br>Extinction Rebellion member Dr Bing Jones said,<i> “Sheffield City Council is neglecting its duty. They have made no real effort to tell the people of Sheffield how risky it is to delay. The Tyndall Report that they commissioned requires massive CO2 emission cuts, now. They are ideally placed to initiate a wide and imaginative discussion but do nothing except delay."</i><br><br><strong> <a href="https://www.xrsheffield.org/">Extinction Rebellion Sheffield</a></strong></div>
