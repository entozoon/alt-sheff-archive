		<td>Brexit, Trump and the rise of European nationalism has meant we now look differently at our identity than we did twelve months ago. This event aims to explore the fluidity of identity in a contemporary world where individuals are potentially left rootless and bereft of any predictable frames of reference. Featuring a panel including Dr Andy Mycock (University of Huddersfield), Pennie Raven (community entrepreneur and activist), Cllr Magid Magid (Green Party) and Deborah Egan OBE (Director of DINA).

In association with Nigel Slack, Active Citizen.
