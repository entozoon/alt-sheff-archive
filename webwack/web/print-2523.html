		<td>Federation of Tenants and Residents Associations in Rotherham holds its annual general meeting. The keynote speaker will be Michael Gelling, chair of the Tenants and Residents Organisation of England (TAROE), who will talk about its aim to create a ‘Tenants Agenda’, by asking tenants present to complete an online survey to identify the top issues concerning them and their families. 

TAROE is concerned that the views of tenants are being ignored by the government and the problems caused by its policies not understood.

Gelling said: “We know there are lots of issues which we all chat about with our friends, neighbours and family, but it never goes anywhere else.  This is a real opportunity to make sure that your views are not only heard but used effectively. The development of this strategy aims to ensure we have a true understanding of the needs and concerns of tenants nationwide.”
