		<td>Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a way of reorganising the economy by replacing means-tested welfare benefits with standard income for all, regardless of working or not. It has been tried in various countries and Sheffield looks likely to be one of the UK trial areas. 

This free event is organised by UBI Lab Sheffield. It features a speaker from <a href="http://www.worldbasicincome.org.uk/">World Basic Income UK</a>, followed by informal discussion and socialising.
