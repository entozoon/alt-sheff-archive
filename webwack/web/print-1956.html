		<td>'I am a very good liar, but everything I'm telling you today is true.' Comedian and activist Mark Thomas will be performing his smart, angry new show, "Cuckooed". It exposes the world of corporate espionage. Just how did BAE Systems, Britain&#39;s biggest arms manufacturer, come to spy on a comedian? A tale of hubris, planes, demos and undercover deceit told by an award winning performer.
