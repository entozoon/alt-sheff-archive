		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. This time the theme is Railways 2, a follow up to last April. 

The ride heads east exploring lines and stations past and present, incorporating tramtracks and hopefully tramsheds too. It may include a ceremonial painting of boulders on the Trans-Pennine Trail with luminous paint – guerilla path safety! NB some paths and tracks – would suit hybrid or town bike, not for swish road bikes! Full details given on the website.
