		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Refugees and people seeking sanctuary are invited to a day of talking, refreshment and entertainment to explore how best to make your voices heard and talents recognised in the city. Should we establish a Refugee Parliament? Are there enough ways for you to express your artistic or other talents? If you've got something to say, come and speak. If you've got something to show, bring it. If you just want to come and listen and watch, come and see!
