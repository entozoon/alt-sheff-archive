		<td>Greta Thunberg has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. She may be given the Woman of the Year Award. She has been nominated for the Vegan of the Year Award. Greta Thunberg is vegan for animals and the planet. She started the school striking because of the simple fact that humans appear to be exterminating life on our planet.

Everyone should join this Sheffield demonstration to keep things like the deteriorating climate, pollution and the fossil-fueled meat industry right at the front of the Council´s attention, and the public´s.
