This regular meeting of the alliance of Sheffield climate activists is open to newcomers, all welcome. Come and find out what the COP21 agreement was really about, and be inspired by hearing from Sheffield activists who were in Paris. Hear about the vigorous Climate Justice movement, international solidarity initiatives and community-based solutions building alternatives to corporate takeover and government inaction. For the second half of the evening, member organisations will give their views on climate action across South Yorkshire, in the light of Paris. This will be an opportunity to connect with them and get involved in resisting fossil fuels, building the movement and creating real alternatives. 

They would like to build a team from the universities, local businesses and societies to look at what a zero carbon future could mean, and how we get there - fast! Get in touch if you want to be involved.

Refreshments available at start and middle of this meeting.
