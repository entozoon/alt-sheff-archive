		<td>Sheffield Friends of the Earth is showing 4 green films, as voted by the public, on Wednesday 1st, 8th, 15th and 22nd February. The Co-operative has kindly provided financial sponsorship of all the films.

America&#39;s biggest oil supplier has quickly become Canada&#39;s oil sands. Located under Alberta&#39;s pristine boreal forests, the process of oil sands extraction uses up to 4 barrels of fresh water to produce only one barrel of crude oil. A struggle is increasingly being fought between water and oil, not only over them. In only a few short years the continent will be a crisscross of pipelines, reaching from the arctic all the way to the southern US, leaving toxic water basins the size of Lake Ontario, and surface-mines as large as Florida. With hope and courage H2Oil tells the story of one of the most significant, and destructive projects of our time.

Malcolm Denman from the Sheffield Hallam University&#39;s Department of Engineering and Mathematics will be present to answer any questions regarding the film. He is a Lecturer, researcher and energy consultant with over 30 years experience, and is Chairman of the South Yorkshire Environment and Energy Management Group. 

Tea, coffee and other refreshments will be available for a small fee. The film festival is free but donations are welcome.
