		<td>Talk arranged by Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign (SPSC) with Mick Napier, chair of Scottish PSC, Joanne Gilmore of University of Manchester Department of Law and Yasmin Ali, Gaza Demonstration Support Group.

The Gaza Strip is still under ongoing Israeli 'Collective Punishment' but demonstrators in the UK, predominantly Muslims, are often arrested and charged with 'racially aggravated conduct' and other public order offences which hold a maximum of 5 years imprisonment. The cases are troubling: it is almost as if the prosecution (and the judge, where people have been found guilty) are saying that criticising Israel, in particular over its actions in Gaza, is in itself racist and anti-Semitic. The implications are far-reaching and represent a serious threat to the freedom of expression and the right to dissent.

Tea and coffee from 7pm, discussion from 7.30pm.
