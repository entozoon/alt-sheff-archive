		<td>A protest in Sheffield for the Stansted 15, people who have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2018/dec/12/stansted-15-the-conviction-of-peaceful-protesters">found guilty of terror-related offences</a> for stopping the flight of a deportation charter plane and thereby saving lives. They were trying to stop the Home Office removing people to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone. As a result 11 people who were on the flight are still in the UK appealing against their removals. This protest will be one of 20 around the UK in solidarity with the Stansted 15 on International Migrants Day. 

SYMAAG (South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group) has been actively involved in the Stansted 15 campaign, and condemns the government crackdown on the right to protest, attempting to terrorise people showing solidarity with people seeking asylum.
