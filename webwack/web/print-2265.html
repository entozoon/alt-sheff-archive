		<td>The Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) at Aldermaston and Burghfield are the nuclear bomb factories which make Britain&#39;s nuclear warheads. Ahead of an  expected Parliamentary vote in 2016 on whether the government should spend over £100 BILLION on a new nuclear weapons system, there will be increasing demonstrations at AWE calling for Trident and its replacement to be scrapped. Come to the demonstration on the roll-out day; the 69th anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki. Hundreds of people have been knitting beautiful pieces of pink wool and crochet to connect the AWE factories with a seven mile pink scarf. 

Coaches from Sheffield are being arranged, with sponsorship from Lush who are very supportive, cost £26 (deposit £10 to book a place). They will set off 7am from top of Pond Hill opposite The Penny Black. Please contact if you want to join in: <a href="mailto:hilarysmith23@hotmail.com">hilarysmith23@hotmail.com</a></td>
