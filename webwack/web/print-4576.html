1pm - Sheffield Socialist Choir will be performing Christmas Carols with a political twist at Heeley City Farm Christmas Fayre - three new carols will be performed which have been adapted with Palestinian words!

Hot off the press: the first ever Sheffield PSC calendar a bargain at Â£5 each, includes lovely photos of SPSC activities and of children from the projects supported in Gaza, and lots of useful information about the campaigning.

And please don't buy any Israeli produce over the holiday period  - if you have time, write a letter or four to all the major supermarkets complaining about the continued sale of 'Israeli' dates in our shops.</td>
