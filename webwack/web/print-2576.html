		<td>Is the National Debt a curse or a blessing?

Positive Money supporter Richard Bruce will be giving a talk on a number of topics relating to the way our money is created. No question the UK Government is in major debt but who do we owe? Will we run out of money? Is China going to take over? 

Positive Money is a movement to democratise money and banking so that it works for society and not against it. In Sheffield, they hold talks on the last Monday of every month (except bank holidays). 

All welcome! Tea/coffee available from 7.15pm (50p) and a voluntary donation requested to cover costs (suggested Â£3)
