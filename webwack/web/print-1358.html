		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A community event organised by Hope Not Hate in partnership with residents, community groups and activists in Rotherham, to truly create positive change in the town. The idea is to bring communities together from across Rotherham. There are really very few circumstances that cannot be improved by gathering people together in a room, and this has to be the starting point for bringing about positive change here in Rotherham. This event, unique to Rotherham, will feature two distinct, but completely interlinked, segments:

1) A short but powerful introduction from individuals skilled and experienced in the art of conflict negotiation and resolution. 

2) A discussion about how people can begin to create change in Rotherham. In a mixture of small group and then full group discussions, exploring the first steps to rebuilding communities.

As the anthropologist Margaret Mead once said: “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it is the only thing that ever has”.
