		<td>Women In Construction, Arts & Technology (WiCAT) run classes in practical trades for women. 

WiCAT has no regular funding and relies on volunteers for every aspect of the work. Many people make regular annual or monthly donations through their <a href="http://www.wicat.org.uk/pledge-a-tenner.html">Pledge a Tenner campaign</a> At present, classes need to be self financing. They are seeking funding to help subsidise some classes in the future so that people on a low income are able to access them.

All classes cost Â£35 each. Booking is through the website below.
