		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Panel discussion with Sophie Walker, leader of the Women’s Equality Party, and guest speakers, looking at women’s poverty in Sheffield and the UK. Is there gender bias in the way traditional economic thinking addresses poverty? Will business development plans be ‘more of the same’ or a lasting solution to poverty?
