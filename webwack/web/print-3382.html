		<td>Palestine Culture Week in Sheffield is planned to coincide with International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People on 29th November. At this time the current horror in Gaza brings into sharp relief the resistance symbolised by cultural activity.

Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign has organised this vigil. Please join in on this important day. There will be a special viewing of a Palestinian art exhibition at Bank Street arts between 6 and 7 after this. All welcome.
