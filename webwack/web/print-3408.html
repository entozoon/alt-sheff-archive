		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. This time a ride postponed from the 9th, on the theme of "Countries of the World". Enterprises, mainly restaurants and cafes, associated with a particular country will be part of a rambling round trip of a bike-ride. The ride will take in at least 40 countries plus a couple of universals (eg Empire Rd, Globe Works). Increase your local knowledge and come back feeling like you have ridden round the world!

It could be a long ride, and a cool night, so be prepared. 

After that, why not come back to the "Sustrans presents Sustained Affairs" event above?
