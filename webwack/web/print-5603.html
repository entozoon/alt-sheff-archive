		<td>Sheffield Live! Gig @ the Harley - An event for Sheffield Live’s Summer Appeal 2009

The city’s freshest and exciting Indie talent. 

RepoMen: acoustic set from Sheffield post-punk new-wavers, putting down their electric guitars in favour of an acoustic and a double bass. 

Sieben: a.k.a. Matt Howden. One man, his violin and loop pedal. Deep, dark, beautiful amd moving. The word genius is often over-used but not  here. Has to be seen to be believed.

Party Horse: Ex-Tiny Dancer’s front man Day Kay and wife Ersula ride into town with a fist full of guitar driven power-pop tunes with a metallic edge. “Like a Anglo/Dutch Fleetwood Mac brought up on grilled cheese”. Tasty!

The night will close with Sheffield Live! DJ sets from the fabulous people behind ‘The Indie Hour’ and ‘The Breakdown.’

£3 gets you in…
