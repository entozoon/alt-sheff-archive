		<td>’Getting Our Message Across – Tenants and Residents Can Make a Difference’ is the theme for Rotherham Federation of Tenants and Residents (RotherFed) 2013 Annual General Meeting. There will be information and a selection of stalls showing how good communication can demonstrate what a big difference tenants and residents associations (TARAs) can achieve in their local communities. Organisations who will be attending with stalls to look around include Guinness Northern Counties Housing Association, Radio Sheffield, Connect2Support, RMBC and Rotherham Gizmo.

The guest speaker will be Ian Clayton, Yorkshire writer and broadcaster. In a freelance career spanning 20 years, Ian has edited and authored more than forty books and broadcast on TV and radio. 

The formal part of the meeting, the Annual General Meeting will include a presentation of the Annual Report and Accounts and the results of elections to the Board. Presentations will be made to those retiring from their positions. All the board are elected volunteers and receive no payment for the work they do as part of RotherFed.

A free buffet will be served at 3.30pm. Though the meeting is open to all Rotherham tenants and residents there is a limited number of places, all of which need to be booked. To book your place contact the RotherFed office on Rotherham 368515 or email <a href="mailto:info@rotherfed.org">info@rotherfed.org</a>. Springwell Gardens Community Centre is on Eastwood View, the nearest bus stop is on Doncaster Road and served by bus 37.
