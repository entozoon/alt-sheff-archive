		<td>Concerned about fracking, climate change and destruction of ecosystems? The Sheffield Socialist Workers&#39; Party hosts a talk by Martin Empson on his book <i>Land and labour: Marxism, Ecology and Human History</i> which argues that, while humans have always changed the world, capitalism unleashes the potential for environmental collapse. Humanity has used and abused the rest of nature for thousands of years, and now in a few hundred years capitalism has brought us to the brink of disaster. Come and hear Martin introduce his book, and take part in a discussion about the alternative to capitalism.
