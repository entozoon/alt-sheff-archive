		<td>The world is currently under the rule of something that has passed the insanity threshold. But this insanity has been normalised as the acceptable. What can be done? How can we try to change this? How can we challenge a system that has done such a good job of asserting itself as reality itself?

Pandemic is a situationist arts event, a continuous programme including visual art, performance, experimental music, lectures/talks, film, demonstration, discussion. Events are in various spaces: 7 Garden St.; Bank Street Arts; Audacious Space 108 Harwood St.; the Riverside pub 1 Mowbray St.; city centre; disused spaces; University of Sheffield, and possibly elsewhere.
