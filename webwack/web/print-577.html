		<td>We abandoned trial by ordeal in the 13th century in favour of trial by jury, but for many women giving evidence in sexual violence trials remains an ordeal. Does this explain why only a small fraction of complaints of sexual violence ever reach court? 

The Women’s Equality Party host a panel discussion featuring founding party leader Sophie Walker and guest speakers discussing what measures can be taken to make the criminal justice system fairer for women and girls who are the victims of sexual violence.

This free event is part of Festival of Debate 2018, coordinated by not-for-profit company Opus Independents, in association with the Women’s Equality Party
