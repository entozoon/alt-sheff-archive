		<td>The launch party and general meeting of the new housing co-operative run by and for students and graduates. The profit gets re-invested into the co-op, rather than going to a landlord. Occupants share the real costs and joys of house maintenance, democratically making all the decisions about finances and management.

11am Annual General Meeting
4pm Party
6pm food; bring a dish to share.
Badge making and screen printing to try as well.
