		<td>A debate on Marxism and Liberal Democracy in association with Sheffield Workers Liberty. What is freedom under liberal democracy, and who is it for? What is freedom of speech and do socialists mean the same thing by it as world leaders? With so much rhetoric from politicians across the world about free societies and human rights, this discussion will look at what value we place on liberal democracy around us and consider what freedom really means.

The Festival of Debate is taking place in Sheffield in the run-up to the General election, during March and April. It provides opportunities to get together and discuss a range of issues which affect everyone. Informed decision making and strategic planning are essential for democracy, so come and get involved. They also welcome volunteers, from attending events and taking part in discussions to volunteering time to help run an event, promote the festival and much more. Unless otherwise stated events are free to attend, but if possible please register via the appropriate Eventbrite link on the Festival of Debate website below to give organsisers an idea of numbers.
