		<td>This pioneering Egyptian film is widely regarded as director Youssef Chahine’s masterpiece. The film tells the story a newspaper vendor working in Cairo train station who becomes infatuated with one of the station’s female beverage sellers. When she rejects his fantasy of their future together, the newspaper vendor’s obsession turns into madness.

The beverage seller is one of a group of unofficial female vendors who dodge the authorities to sell soft drinks to passengers. She is engaged to marry a loud and heavy-handed porter who is trying to form a trade union. Meanwhile, local newspapers report on a gruesome murder...

Cairo Station is screening as part of Africa 3.0, a mini-strand showcasing stories of obsession from the African continent. Part of Film Feels: Obsession, a UK-wide cinema season, supported by the National Lottery and BFI Film Audience Network.
