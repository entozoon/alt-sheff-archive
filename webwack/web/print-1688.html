		<td>The 9th annual Doncaster Pride festival celebrating lesbian, gay bisexual and transgender (LGBT) culture is open to all. In fact the organisers are positively promoting the event to anyone in Doncaster and surrounding areas as a way to bring together the wider community to enjoy the day with them. They have also teamed up this year with local branch NUM and local collieries, including the recently closed Hatfield Colliery, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the miners returning to work after the strike. An unusual combination of groups? Well, not really, as anyone who saw the film "Pride" will know. There is history between the mining communities and the LGBT community dating back to the 80s when the group Lesbian and Gays support the Mineworkers (LGSM) raised money for striking miners and their families. There will be miners carrying banners, Women Against Pit Closures and possibly even the LGSM members from London. Sheffield City Pipe Band will lead the march, giving the mining communities of Doncaster a reason to march, unfurl their banners proudly and lead the walk through the streets of Doncaster.

The main stage features over 8 hours of dance, music and drag as well as market stalls, fairground rides and information providers including Doncaster Pride Youth Project that is working in Doncaster schools to help support young people, families and educators to stamp out homophobia in schools and deal with issues around sexuality.
