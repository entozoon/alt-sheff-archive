		<td>The "Wrap up Trident" demonstration in London; Parliament and the Ministry of Defence will be wrapped in a fabulous pink scarf. This is to draw attention to these deadly Â£100Bn machines of destruction. Whatever government is elected in May 2015 will make the decision in 2016 on replacing or scrapping them.

Yorkshire CND will pick up people from this area wanting to go at Meadowhall. Please contact Yorkshire CND via email: <a href="mailto:cath@yorkshirecnd.org.uk">cath@yorkshirecnd.org.uk</a>
