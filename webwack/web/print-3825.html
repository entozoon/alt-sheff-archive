		<td>The World Development Movement (WDM) is a UK-based anti-poverty campaigning organisation with actions to debate, understand and change things. For one-off, room-booking reasons, this next campaigning meeting (only) has had to be moved from its regular first-Thursday slot to the SECOND WEDNESDAY in April. 

Sorting out plans for the programme of summer festivals, including developing ideas for eye-catching gimmicks and ideas for updating displays for the summer stalls. Come and join in the fun.
