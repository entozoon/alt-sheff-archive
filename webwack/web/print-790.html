		<td>After the shocking fire at Grenfell Tower in London last week, we need to be looking at the reasons why this hideous event occurred. And holding people, organisations, politicians to account. 

We need to be making sure that tenants in our area - and elsewhere - know that immediate steps are being taken to ensure that their homes are safe. This is a man-made disaster that should never have happened. Funding cuts and government policies, especially over the last 7 years, have contributed to this shocking loss of life.

This is a Peoples Assembly meeting arranged at short notice - but please make every effort to come. They will also be selling coach tickets for the national demonstration on  1st July in London called by the PA to demand "Not One Day More - Tories Out".
