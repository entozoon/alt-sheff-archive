		<td>Sheffield city centre boycott event in the city centre, leafleting outside a Sheffield supermarket complicit in Israel's crimes, and in support of Palestinians inside and outside occupied territory. 

Please consider joining in even if you havenâ€™t been to a protest before: people needed to leaflet under a huge banner outside the supermarket. Some supporters will be away for Easter, so if you are in Sheffield, please try and join in. The whole protest usually lasts a maximum of an hour and a half.

Email <a href="mailto:boycottisraeligoods@live.co.uk">boycottisraeligoods@live.co.uk</a> if you want to take part and SPSC will send you details.
