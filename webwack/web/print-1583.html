		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Sheffield Open Rights Group (ORG) campaigns on digital freedoms. Come along to discuss the Investigatory Powers Bill. The government have now published their draft for a new law that will extend the surveillance powers of the police and GCHQ; MPs have until January to examine it. 

The draft bill brings more legal transparency which is welcome, but it does also permit mass surveillance:
• It allows GCHQ to continue collecting huge amounts of internet traffic under programs like Tempora. These powers should be curtailed and not maintained.
• It will force ISPs to store a record of every website visited in the last 12 months and will make this information available to the police and local government.
• It will force business to assist with encrypting communications - essentially weakening the provision of encrypted services.

ORG will be handing out a fact sheet outlining the key points, and is campaigning for the powers granted in the bill to comply with the "Don't Spy on Us" 6 principles of surveillance.   

The meeting will be in the main room of the pub. Look out for an ORG sign on the table.
