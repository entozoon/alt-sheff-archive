		<td>A Skeptics in the Pub get-together; a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to a talk, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. Talks are typically about a common belief that can be demonstrated to be false or cannot be justified by the available evidence. 

This month, Sarah Beck, Reader in Cognitive Development at the University of Birmingham, explains why children are great pretenders, poor problem solvers, and sometimes less clever than crows. Children are excellent imaginers, coming up with all kinds of creative and weird worlds. But what is the imagination really for? 

These events are free though they ask for a Â£3 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
