		<td>Are you vegan, or do you want to find out more about a lifestyle completely free of any animal exploitation? Come and make friends, drink and eat vegan food at Sheffield Vegan Meet Up. 

This time is a bit different - a cinema trip to see Blackfish - the story of a performing killer whale that killed several people while in captivity. It challenges us to consider our relationship to nature and reveals how little we humans have learned from these highly intelligent and enormously sentient fellow mammals. Shocking footage and emotional interviews explore the creature’s extraordinary nature, the species’ cruel treatment in captivity, the lives and losses of the trainers and the pressures brought to bear by the mulit-billion dollar sea-park industry.

Film starts at 8.45pm. Meet in the Showroom cinema bar at 8pm if you would like a drink and a chat beforehand.
