<a href="https://soundcloud.com/iglew92">Iglew</a> 
Discovering electronic music through podcasts rather than raves and coming lately to soundsystem culture, rising producer Iglew is hyper aware of how effective bass can be, and produces music that is stark but devestatingly emotive. Urban Myth, Iglew’s debut EP, was the first vinyl release on Mr Mitch’s Gobstopper Records label.

<a href="https://soundcloud.com/timbahbeats">Timbah</a>
Originally from Nottingham but now based in Leeds, Timbah has two releases on Bad Taste Records. His debut, ‘Can’t Love Without You’ received widespread praise for its unique textures. Most recent EP ‘Flow Poke’. Get ready for hype tune after hype tune.

<a href="https://soundcloud.com/wolfetime">Wölfe</a>
Wölfe are no strangers to the Sheffield scene having played a number of free parties across the city, and their productions and remixes have been getting airplay and attention all over. Expect bouncy soulful dancefloor smashers and chilling sub bass drops.

<a href="https://saifmode.bandcamp.com/">Saif Mode</a>
Saif Mode marry meditative drones and techno improvisations, recalling the utopian dreams of the Atomic Age and the simple piety of the early church. Their sound chimes as much with the Yorkshire beeps and bleeps scene as with the weightless turn in instrumental grime, equally at home on bills with improvised analogue electronica and raw black metal.

<a href="https://soundcloud.com/greg_white/">Greg White</a>
Expect some droning, gloomy ambient music to start the event from the Force Majeure resident DJ. Everything from Ben Frost to William Basinski, and back again.

Tickets from: <a href="https://tickets.partyforthepeople.org.uk/events/1272-force-majeure-1-11-9-15-iglew-timbah-wolfe-saif-mode">Party for the People</a>, £6 in advance/£8 on the door. All proceeds will go to <a href="https://sheffieldafn.wordpress.com/">Sheffield Anti-Fascist Network</a>.</td>
