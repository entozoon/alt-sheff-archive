		<td>Come join the Hilltop Action Group on a demo march to show opposition to open cast mining. A local community near Clay Cross just heard in April about a proposal to open cast mine 30 hectares (75 acres) of perfectly good farmland. A company called Provectus plan to excavate around 200,000 tonnes of coal, to a depth of 100ft over a 3-4 year period. They hope to sell it to Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station, which would keep the power station running for about 2 weeks! 

The action begins at 10.30am from the Royal Oak car park, Tupton, on the A61 (postcode S42 6LA). Bring your family, dog, a picnic, banners and placards.
