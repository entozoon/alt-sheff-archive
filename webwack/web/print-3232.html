		<td>A bike ride on a parks and woodlands route, along quiet roads and paths to Millhouses Park (where people can also join in by the cafe if they like, leaving there about 10.15), then crossing over to Ecclesall Woods following bridlepaths to Ryecroft Glen and to Whirlow, to Ringinglow Road, Forge Dam and on down to Bingham Park, Endcliffe Park and then taking the quiet back route through Broomhall and back to Barkers Pool by about 1.30pm. The whole route is less than 12 miles, at a gentle pace and walking the only steep bit. If you plan to go on the ride please leave a message so the organiser can plan for numbers. If you want to join, or leave, at other points along the way that is fine; let her know where, and she can text you an approximate time that the ride will reach you.
