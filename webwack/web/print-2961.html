		<td>The annual commercially-sponsored inner-city festival. More popular every year (last year over 80,000 people). Apply for tickets for the main events or visit the huge programme of bands in surrounding pubs.

Nokia has pulled out of sponsoring it this year, and with pressure on council budgets, sadly they have to charge for SOME parts of the festival. It’s not expensive though, and there are loads of free areas like Weston Park, Folk Forest, Cathedral, and free family entertainment remains on offer around the city and most of the city’s pubs. The website also details how to arrive without polluting the environment - see "Not Driving".
