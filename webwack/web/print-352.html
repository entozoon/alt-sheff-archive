		<td>After many many years of running a venue at Shambala Festival the Rebel Soul crew bring their unique blend of politics and party to Sheffield's awesome Dina Venue. Rebel Soul is politics thinly veiled as entertainment. They host the country’s frontline campaigners and celebrate with bangin’ bands and DJs. All proceeds go to support grassroots campaigns (Last year: Abortion Support Networt, Akwaaba Social Centre, Sea Watch, Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants, & Frack Free Tinker Lane).

<strong> Daytime free workshops
