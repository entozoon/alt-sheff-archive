		<td>Heeley City Farm is running extra crafts sessions in the Energy Centre every Thursday during the school holidays, on 24th and 31st July, 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th August, 12-3pm. Glitter, glue and sunshine! Wear clothes you don&#39;t mind getting messy in! The Farm doesn&#39;t receive any funding for these activities, so cost will help to pay for materials and raise some money for the Farm to keep going too. All children must be supervised by their parents/carers whilst doing crafts. Sheffield Children&#39;s University Credits can be collected here.

Ring Sharon for more information on Sheff 3039981 or email <a href="mailto:sharon.syec@heeleyfarm.org.uk">sharon.syec@heeleyfarm.org.uk</a>. Heeley City Farm is 20 mins walk from Sheffield, or catch the No 47 bus to Herdings from town - it drops you right outside the Farm. Â£1 contribution for each child taking part, grown-ups free.
