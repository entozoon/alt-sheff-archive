		<td>Everyone has a responsibility to condemn sexual exploitation and support the victims. By contrast, fascist groups across Britain are trying to cynically exploit the crime of grooming to spread racism and divide communities. The far right&#39;s racist agenda has been boosted by the way sections of the media and some politicians have given legitimacy to racist myths about grooming.

A seminar organised by One Sheffield Many Cultures, with Ratna Lachman, director of JUST West Yorkshire which promotes racial justice, civil liberties and human rights in the north of England. She has written articles on grooming in the national press. Also Sheila Taylor, director of the National Working Group for Sexually Exploited Children and Young People. She became the Chief executive of the NWG Network in 2011, a network organisation of almost 1200 members who all have an interest in tackling the issues of Child Sexual Exploitation.

Both speakers bring invaluable insights to the discussion of the real nature of grooming and how best to overcome the attempts to turn it into a racist issue. All welcome.
