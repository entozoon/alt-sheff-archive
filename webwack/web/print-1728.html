		<td>Screening of a film directed by Orson Nava. It covers the ways in which increasing numbers of people are having to take on the role of border-guards as employers, landlords, health workers and educators are legally required to administer the UK border as part of their everyday lives. The film considers the implications of this for those required to enforce the border, those subject to this enforcement and the whole of society.
