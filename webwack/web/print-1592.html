		<td>Peace in the Park is so much more than just the one day free festival… Fundraising continues throughout the year, be it gigs, bake offs or pop ups. They need to raise at least £18000 each year to make the festival happen and all that money comes from the generosity of the people of Sheffield. Together we can make Peace in the Park 2016 a reality!

Currently there is small core of people that make up the steering Group who regularly meet to look at the big picture of the festival. As they build up the momentum for 2016 they are looking for people to get involved and make it happen with us. 
Peace in the Park needs YOU! Meet at the Hallamshire House on the 12th November to discuss how you want to get involved – big or small ideas are all welcome. Or maybe you just want to pop along to show your support and that’s fine too.
