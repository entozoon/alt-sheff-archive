It campaigns both for the rights of those seeking asylum and of those coming to work in this country. This month they will discuss anti-detention campaigning, ideas from new members about campaign priorities and how to continue the momentum of the Refugees Welcome protest in Sheffield.

Note the new venue and day: Theatre Delicatessen is the former Woolworths building on The Moor.
