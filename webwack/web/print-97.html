		<td>A protest against the cruel and inhumane treatment of detainees at Morton Hall detention centre, in Lincolnshire. It is a prison contracted to the Home Office as an Immigration Removal Centre (IRC) and can detain 392 people. There have been several deaths in recent years inside its walls, with nearly half the detainees feeling suicidal or depressed according to a 2017 Prison Inspectors report. 

People detained at Morton Hall welcome protests and are encouraged by them. Join South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG), Sheffield Student Action for Refugees (STAR), These Walls Must Fall, and many others at the demonstration. The actual protest is 12-3pm, with banners and chanting while surrounding Morton Hall Immigration Detention Centre (Morton Hall Village, Swinderby, Lincoln LN6 9PT). Transport from Sheffield leaves at 10am, returning around 5pm to Sheffield. Free tickets for people seeking asylum. For transport from Sheffield or any other enquiry contact: <a href="mailto:dignitynotdetention@yahoo.co.uk">dignitynotdetention@yahoo.co.uk</a>, tel: 07768 429659 or 07810 214556.
