		<td><a href="http://www.neweconomics.org/">New Economics Foundation (NEF)</a> presents a session exploring why the dominant economic ideas of today place short-term consumerism and the interests of big business over long-term wellbeing and social and environmental justice. In a fun and interactive setting, they ask what we can do to change course. No prior knowledge of economics needed (or indeed useful). Hosted by Christine Berry and Tim Jenkins of NEF.
