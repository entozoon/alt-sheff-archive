		<td>Ongoing NHS crises inevitably prompt debates about the future of public healthcare in the UK. Is privatisation inevitable and what will be the impact? Well, we know the answer to that one already as two parts of the NHS were privatised 30 years ago - eye care and dentistry. Join an optometrist and dentist to debate the verdict so far.

This free event is part of <a href="https://www.festivalofdebate.com/">Festival of Debate 2018</a>, coordinated by not-for-profit company Opus Independents, in association with EYEYE.
