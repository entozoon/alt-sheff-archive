		<td>Protest urging people to boycott Israeli businesses in occupied Palestine. Please, please join this boycott walk round Sheffield city centre, BIG banner and BIG placards, lots of leaflets to give out, will be visible amongst the Christmas shoppers! The situation for the Palestinians is now far worse than it ever was in South Africa (terrible though that that was) and there is overwhelming support for boycott amongst Palestinians. 

Assembling outside the Town Hall at 11am for a slow march around the city centre, leafleting, and stopping at a number of stores which sell Israeli goods. If possible, please bring musical instruments, and wear a boycott t-shirt if you have one (email <a href="mailto:boycottisraeligoods@live.co.uk">boycottisraeligoods@live.co.uk</a> to order one).
