		<td>Yorkshire Ambulance Service calls itself "An Aspirant Foundation Trust". Whatever that means, it must be trying to improve itself. Therefore it is sad to note that its cycling paramedic service is to be closed today. The Trust makes little comment about whether this gave better emergency response times within the city. Obviously in an emergency which caused traffic to back-up, a paramedic on a bike could well be a great help. But in addition it surely was a great sign to young people that cycling is socially useful, is associated with health, it can be part of our working lives, in short cycling paramedics among the busy city traffic can be role models and symbols of a better way to do things, above and beyond their obvious function. 

But the service is to end today, so on this final day the "normal" critical mass ride will include people wearing bandages and fake blood to signify the death of this service. It will be a cycling escort for Jonathan, the cycling paramedic.

Critical Mass is a monthly cycle ride in celebration of the bicycle as the most efficient, peaceful and perfect mode of transport, a self-organised movement, on the last Friday of each month.

Sheffield Critical Mass usually gets together from 6pm but does not start moving off until 6.30pm
