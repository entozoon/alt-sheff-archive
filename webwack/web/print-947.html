		<td>Every December, Amnesty supporters across the globe will write millions of letters for people whose basic human rights are being attacked. It is all part of Write for Rights, their global letter-writing marathon. One of the world’s biggest human rights events, it carries on a long tradition of people like you, writing letters to right some of the world’s biggest wrongs.

The Sheffield group makes greeting cards that are sent to those suffering from human rights violations in the hope that the message shows their fight for justice. Come down, make a card, eat a mince pie and make a difference!
