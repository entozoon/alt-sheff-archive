		<td>WDM aims to change the actions, policies and institutions of governments, corporations and wealthy minorities, which are preventing an end to poverty and injustice. Part of a global movement, it works alongside people protesting in the developing world. The organising meeting of WDM is held on the first Thursday of each month, to discuss coming events and campaigns including actions on the campaigns about Agribusiness and TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  between the USA and the EU), the corporate trade deal which threaten to increase global inequality, undermine democracy and hand public service provision to multinational companies. It is a dangerous blueprint that must be stopped before it is rolled out around the world.

Meetings are usually followed by informal gathering in the nearby <i>Church House</i> pub, approx. 9.15-10.15pm. If you plan to come only to the pub then please contact (phone 07800 666553 or leave a message at the QMH), as occasionally the group does not go to the pub.
