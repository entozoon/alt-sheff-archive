Peter will describe the hierarchical organisation of decision making showing that, over the course of brain evolution, behavioural options have evolved with the species, but the mechanism for selecting between them has been conserved from fish to reptile, from mammal to man. He will describe the structures that seems to act as the brain’s generic selection mechanism and what factors determine which option gets selected. He will consider our sense of agency (the subjective feeling that we have made a decision) and whether the concepts of free will and personal responsibility have any place in the neural networks of the basal ganglia.

Skeptics in the Pub events are free though they ask for a £3 donation, and the meetings are open to all.
