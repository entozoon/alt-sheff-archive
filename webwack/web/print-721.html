		<td>A reminder that Foodhall Café offers food that would have been thrown away, surplus donated by retailers, on a pay-as-you-feel basis. It is run by volunteers and encourages community engagement between the general public including students, homeless people, mental health groups, isolated people, people with addiction problems and people who need to access food. 

You can help, whether by just visiting to eat and socialise, or maybe food preparation, or even playing the house piano. 

The cafe opens Thursdays to Saturdays, there are also art workshops and reading groups, and some nights it becomes a DIY venue for fundraiser gigs.
