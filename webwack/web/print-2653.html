		<td>You are warmly invited to the next meeting of SCACC, hosting the wider Sheffield Climate Alliance, and also some people will be meeting at the Blue Moon cafe to eat beforehand from 6pm - do join them there for an informal get-together if you like. 

This month they will mainly focus on two current campaigns:
- Anti-fracking locally, as part of keeping fossil fuels in the ground - what is your council doing, and what else should be done as part of the campaign?
- Climate Jobs as the alternative way forward - how can we see a major programme locally (such as set out in the mini-Stern report) investing in making homes warmer and businesses more energy efficient? 

There will also be progress to report on:
- Joining the Stop Climate Chaos Coalition
- Application for funding to develop campaigning work
- Joint campaigning with churches, universities and pension funds on fossil fuel divestment
