		<td>Sheffield Save Our NHS is fighting the appalling government plans for cuts, competition and privatization for the benefit of private companies, especially the large ones like SERCO and Virgin. Local interest in campaigning for the NHS is building up again. Barnsley already has a Keep Our NHS Public Group, and more campaigning is likely to surface in Doncaster and Rotherham. There is also a regional link including Leeds and York. Get involved, show your support for the NHS.
