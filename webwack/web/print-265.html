		<td>A new verbatim play about adoption, identity and belonging, sharing stories gathered from adoptees living all over the world. Inspired by Naomi’s experiences as a trans-racial adoptee, being adopted from Hong Kong into a White British family, the play gives adoptees the opportunity to share their adoption story in their own words and reveal what it’s like to grow up in a family and community who might look very different to themselves. The focus of the piece is what the contributors perceive as the similarities and differences between themselves and their family members and how both nature and nurture influence identity.
