		<td>Sheffield´s Sudanese community have organised a march and rally (from opposite The Crucible Theatre) in support of the Sudanese people´s uprising against dictatorship.

Meet Saturday 26 January 2pm  for a short march around the city centre with a rally at Sheffield Town Hall which will include reports from people in direct contact with the people´s uprising in Sudan.

Although 50 people have now been killed by the military dictatorship of Omar al Bashir <strong>the uprising continues and has now spread to every city in Sudan. As one of the organisers of Saturday´s protest explained "We have come too far to stop now. We are not scared of our government anymore".
</strong>
The protest is one of many taking place across the UK and aims to inform people in the UK about what is happening in Sudan and to call for support from the <strong>British government (which has previously backed the Sudanese dictatorship)</strong>. One of reasons for people being forced to become refugees from Sudan has been the repression of al Bashir´s government of people in Darfur and now across Sudan. 

The Sudanese community welcomes people of all nationalities to their event on Saturday.
