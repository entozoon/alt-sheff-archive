WiCAT has no regular funding and relies on volunteers for every aspect of the work. Many people make regular annual or monthly donations through their <a href="http://www.wicat.org.uk/pledge-a-tenner.html">Pledge a Tenner campaign</a>. Most classes cost Â£35 each (all day). Booking is through the website.
