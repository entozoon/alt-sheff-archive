		<td>Absurdist Comedians explain and illustrate the world of contemporary political taxonomy (who are all these people and what hole did they climb out of?) and the righteous struggles ahead (which of them do I need to push back into their hole?). Devised by Sean Morley (“Setting the bar for alternative comedy,” Our Favourite Places) and Jack Evans (“As inventive and unsettling as a one-man League Of Gentlemen,” Vice).
