		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A meeting to discuss activism against the proposed Housing & Planning Act, which would make the housing crisis much worse. It would break up families and communities, using short term, insecure tenancies for council tenants, and forcing more people into insecure private renting as the council housing stock dwindles. Several councils have already stated their opposition to the Act, but Sheffield City Council has not yet done so.

The meeting will cover the <a href="https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/sheffield-axe-the-housing-act-campaign">Sheffield Axe the Housing Act petition</a>, Unite Housing Crisis Road show, working with Renters Rising and various other actions.
