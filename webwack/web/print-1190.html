		<td>Following Brexit, the new right-wing government led by Theresa May is weak and vulnerable. Instead of taking advantage of this open goal and calling for a snap general election, the right wing of The Labour Party which cannot abide Jeremy Corbyn as its leader has created a false crisis for the party and triggered an unnecessary leadership contest. We have to defend Corbyn’s anti-austerity stance.

Come along to this Emergency Open Organising Meeting to discuss strategy in Sheffield, how to link with the Labour left in the city and to plan activities for the next few weeks.
