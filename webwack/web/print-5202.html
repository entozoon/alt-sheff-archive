		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride offers a monthly evening bike ride with a theme, for everyone. Their motto? "We have nothing to lose but our chains!" (But bring locks and lights too, just in case).

This time meet in the carpark of the West End pub to visit significant social housing in Broomhall, town centre, Wincobank, Norfolk Park and Heeley before finishing in Sheaf View or the Union pub.
