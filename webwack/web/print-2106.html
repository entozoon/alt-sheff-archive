		<td>LaDIYFest Sheffield is a DIY, anti-capitalist, community based, feminist festival run by volunteers, led primarily by women but all are welcome to get involved. It aims to highlight female and LGBTQ art, projects and activism in the community, promoting social change in a non-discriminatory environment. 

This is the annual main event, with workshops running between 11am – 5.30pm at Quaker Meeting House, 10 St James St. S1 2EW. Vegan food and refreshments for sale, plus zines, stalls, a quiet room and a supervised children’s area.

This year’s workshop themes include: Trigger warnings, Lifting free weights, Solidarity across lines of difference in feminist struggles, Construction work, How to facilitate/chair workshops and meetings, Challenging sexism in the workplace, Gender and mental health, Toilet politics, Sexual consent, Angry Patch Making, Gendered Abuse in Activist Communities, Palestinian Women in the Non Violent Resistance. All genders are welcome to attend all the workshops. Some workshops will be very child-friendly so please bring your children along if you’d like to.

Evening gig from 8pm at Red House, 168 Solly St. S1 4BB. Featuring: Mega Emotion, Petrol Girls, Bad Librarian.
 
There is a suggested donation of £6 for the day-time event or £8 for both events, but people attending are welcome to pay as much or as little as they can afford. No one will be turned away due to a lack of funds. This is a fundraiser for WiCAT.
