		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride offers a monthly evening bike ride.  Their motto? “We have nothing to lose but our chains”! (But bring locks and lights, just in case).

Tonight a recce to check out the proposed route for Hidden Hillsborough (see website). Maybe do it if you can't join the Sheffield FridayNightRide of the same route on Sep 4. It's about 13 miles. Peel off when you like. This ride will also be the CycleSheffield Tuesday night ride this week.
