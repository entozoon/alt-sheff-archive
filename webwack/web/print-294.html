		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Highly acclaimed Kenyan film Rafiki featured in the Cannes Film Festival in 2018, and was then controversially banned from being shown in Kenya by the Kenya Film Classification Board for its bold approach to LGBTQ+ representation. With beautiful scenes connected through shades of fuchsia and violet, reflecting the femininity of the characters, this gentle film follows the development of love between two young women. 

Brought to Sheffield by <a href="http://www.ayadistribution.org/">Aya Distribution</a>, which focuses on African cinema. Some showings will include a Q&A with director Wanuri Kahiu, and also an DJ night.
