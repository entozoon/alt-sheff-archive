		<td>Building on the success of the 'Eat sustainably' workshops run by Leeds Permaculture Network in 2009, the Cooperative is now working with the Permaculture Association to offer day long sessions that will help you find out about creating a greener household and how you can work with others in your community using Transition Town initiatives and permaculture to develop a more eco-friendly neighbourhood. 

The days will be held in each of the nine northern regions, and will bring together cooperative members, transition town groups and permaculture practitioners. 

Each day will include interactive workshops, presentations from local groups, stalls, lunch and an optional afternoon networking session where people can find out about a brand new Â£1000 grant for 'Transition Projects' in each region to help projects that are aiming to make their neighbourhood a healthier more sustainable place to live. 

You don't need to have any previous experience or eco-knowledge to attend, just a desire to make a difference. An interesting, rewarding and fun day is guaranteed! Workshops in the morning followed by lunch and networking in the afternoon. There will be 4 workshops at each event: Keeping bees; Create a sustainable home using permaculture concepts; A local permaculture project and how to get involved; and one on a local issue identified by the Transition groups in each area, ranging from thermal imaging projects to creating a local food website. 

Places are free but limited to 50 for each event. Please contact to book a place <a href="http://www.permaculture.org.uk/coop2010">The Permaculture Association website</a>  or phone 0113 2307461</td>
