		<td>Sheffield Friends of the Earth is showing 4 green films, as voted by the public, on Wednesday 1st, 8th, 15th and 22nd February. The Co-operative has kindly provided financial sponsorship of all the films.

The Economics of Happiness describes a world moving simultaneously in two opposing directions. On the one hand, government and big business continue to promote globalisation and the consolidation of corporate power. At the same time, all around the world people are resisting those policies, demanding a re-regulation of trade and finance—and, far from the old institutions of power, they&#39;re starting to forge a very different future. Communities are coming together to re-build more human scale, ecological economies based on a new paradigm –an economics of localization.

Dimitris Ballas from the University of Sheffield&#39;s geography department will be present to answer any questions regarding the film. 

Tea, coffee and other refreshments will be available for a small fee. The film festival is free but donations are welcome.
