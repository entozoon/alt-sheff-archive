		<td>There is more information in the world than ever before - but who&#39;s in control? At the centre sits the Establishment who have more knowledge about us and more power, than ever before. Circling them is a new generation of campaigners and internet activists who no longer accept that the Establishment should run the show. Heather Brooke takes us inside the Information War and explores the most urgent questions of the digital age. 

Heather Brooke is a multi-award winning freelance journalist and Freedom of Information campaigner famous for uncovering the MPs&#39; expenses scandal. She is a visiting professor at City University&#39;s Department of Journalism and the author of Your Right to Know and The Silent State.

Part of <b>Off the Shelf</b>, Sheffield&#39;s 21-year old annual festival of words, with a great programme of over 200 events this year. Between 13th October and 3rd November 2012, there is everything from community events to readings to workshops, at various venues.
