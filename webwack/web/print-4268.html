		<td>Director Emily James spent over a year embedded in activist groups Climate Camp, Climate Rush and Plane Stupid, documenting the planning and plotting of direct action. With unprecedented access, the film gives a fun but earnest glimpse into a community of people who refuse to sit back and allow the destruction of their world. Just Do It introduces a powerful cast of mischievous and inspiring characters who put their bodies in the way. They super-glue themselves to bank trading floors, blockade factories and attack coal power stations en-masse all with a hefty dose of wit, creativity and fun. Check out <a href="http://just-do-it.org.uk/">just-do-it.org.uk</a> to watch the trailer. 

With much hurrah, this is the World Premiere of Just Do It, part of Sheffield Doc Fest, along with a rousing talk from Director Emily James. <a href="http://bit.ly/kHzf88">You can nab tickets here.</a> They're selling quick so don't delay.</td>
