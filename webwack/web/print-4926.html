		<td>This gripping drama centres on the journey of a Muslim man and Christian woman as they search for their children following the 2005 London bombings. As the story unfolds, they learn that remarkably their children had been living together and the two families' very different backgrounds are brought together for a hard look at overcoming racial prejudice, emotional exploration and discovery.
