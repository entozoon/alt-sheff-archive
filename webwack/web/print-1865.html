		<td>Positive Money (Sheffield), monthly talk. Positive Money campaigns to create a money and banking system that works FOR society and not AGAINST it, holding public talks the last Monday of the month.

Sarah Mirza gives the talk this month.

"Banking and Equality" - why don&#39;t these two words go together? We explore how the current banking system creates a money circuit that perpetuates Inequality. Inequality is bad for everyone, even the rich. As the gap between rich and poor increases out of control, the effects of inequality get worse. How will Positive Money&#39;s reforms and proposals put a stop to inequality and debt? Come and find out. 

Refreshments (50p) from 7.15, talk starts at 7.30pm. Donation of Â£3 per head requested to cover costs.
