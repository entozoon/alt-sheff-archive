		<td>Sheffield Peoples’ Assembly are highlighting injustices like key workers dying as they carry out essential work. 
Transport workers, health workers and office workers have died. 
Testing for care workers is still mostly unavailable.
The government shows no sign of providing it for other key workers and their families. 
Waitrose is demanding that their work force ‘pay back’ any hours they take for self-isolation.
<strong>Self-isolation means loss of pay for most workers.   
Social distancing is not being provided for in many workplaces. 
Non-essential work is still being demanded by employers.
</strong>
Sheffield People’s Assembly invite you to join a panel discussion with:

    Dave Ward - General Secretary of The Communications Workers’ Union (CWU),  
    Helen O’Connor GMB regional organiser - representing retail and manual workers,
    Jac Berry -  ICU Sister and Unison NEC member (own capacity),
    Laura Pidcock - People’s Assembly National Secretary

The event will finish a couple of minutes before 8pm to clap for our NHS and care workers – make as much noise as you can with pots, pans and drums in protest over lack of PPE for workers.

Posters demanding PPE and testing are available to download for printing at the Peoples’ Assembly <a href="https://www.thepeoplesassembly.org.uk/index.php/web-resources">Resource Page</a>.
