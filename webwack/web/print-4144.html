		<td>Cold reading is a psychological skill that is used by people such as fortune tellers, astrologers, clairvoyants and mediums. They convince people they have never met before that they are able, just from their presence, to divine accurate details of their history, their personal life and their personality, and even to contact the spirits of loved ones who have passed away.

This workshop will provide participants with a basic grounding in the techniques of cold reading which they can practice in their everyday lives. Tony Youens has appeared on a number of television and radio programmes and is a founding member of ASKE, the Association for Skeptical Enquiry. 

Skeptics in the Pub talks are open to all whatever your beliefs and views. Entry is free though they ask for a Â£2 donation.
