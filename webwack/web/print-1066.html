		<td>With a broad educationalist background and 16 years of focusing on the EUâ€™s trade agreements, Linda Kaucher works to raise public awareness of the dangers inherent in these deals and to oppose them. 

After Brexit, there are still EU deals in which the UK is a key player with continuing liabilities. Also there are threats from new deals that the government is set to negotiate.
