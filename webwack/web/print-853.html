		<td>Quiz Night fun to raise money for the Migration Matters Festival (a week-long series of events in June promoting migration, people who work with refugees, amplifying migrant voices and generally putting a positive message about an issue that is frankly a race to the bottom in mainstream politics). 

Apart from the quizzing fun there will be wonderful book prizes donated by radical publishers Pluto and Verso, a raffle, drinks, snacks and enjoyment. Come along, help raise money for a good cause. 

Suggested donation Â£5. Hosted by <a href="http://jeppsbooks.co.uk/">Jepps radical bookshop</a>.
