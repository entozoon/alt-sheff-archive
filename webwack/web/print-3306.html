		<td>Sheffield Equality Group meetings aim to be an open space where people can discuss and plan actions around income equality. Meetings are on the first Wednesday in every month. The group is an autonomous group affiliated to the national Equality Trust. 

This month an informal presentation and discussion about Universalism: will the removal of universal benefits damage how people perceive social support, and make further cuts to social support more likely?  Also on the agenda: Living Wage and the Fairness Commission. All welcome.
