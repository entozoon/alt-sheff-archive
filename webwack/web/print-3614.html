		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Discussion subject for this month is Liberia: Life After Deportation. Graham Birkin will talk about his recent visit to Liberia, following the deportation of a Liberian national from the UK. A rare chance to hear an eyewitness account of what happens to people after they are deported and a picture of life in the under-reported west African country. 

Two good sources of information about Liberia are <a href="http://www.pambazuka.org/en">Pambazuka News</a> and <a href="http://allafrica.com/liberia">All Africa News</a>

The meeting will also cover the SYMAAG role in regional campaigns for asylum rights, updates on local and regional campaigns against G4S and their sub-contractors in asylum housing, and campaigning against the new Family Migration rules.

If you think there is an issue of asylum and migrant rights that should be looked at, then come to the meeting and tell SYMAAG about it.

SYMAAG unites refugee, asylum and migrant organisations with campaign groups and supporting individuals. It campaigns both for the rights of those seeking asylum and of those coming to work in this country. If you want to come to any SYMAAG meeting but find it hard to afford transport do not be put off!  Please bring your ticket or a receipt and SYMAAG can pay you back at the meeting. Or check in advance.
