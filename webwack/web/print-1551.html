		<td>Regular meeting for individuals and agencies working with asylum seekers, refugees and migrants. 

This month the session will spend one hour on usual business followed by "Hackathon" where local volunteer geeks will offer their expertise to groups working with asylum seekers and refugees. Discussion about how digital solutions can help the work. To keep these ideas realistic for a small group of techies to complete over a weekend, please come along with ideas for existing websites or apps to be used in a new or different ways, or problems that need solving rather than a fully worked up technical idea. This will help to provide a solution that fits with the number of people available and time they can give.
