		<td>Purple and green copies of the free Hannah Directory will be appearing in leaflet racks when the 4th edition launches on the week of 6th June 2016. Hannah Directory celebrates 50 people and organisations ‘doing great stuff‘ across the north of England. This year the Sheffield selection includes both <strong>Alt-Sheff</strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.webarchitects.coop/">Webarchitects</a></strong>, the eco-friendly Sheffield co-operative which supports Alt-Sheff with website hosting.

Distributed by hand through its network of participants and supporters, Hannah Directory is a not-for-profit initiative. Contributors are chosen on merit and there is no fee for inclusion. It is named after and inspired by Hannah Mitchell (1872–1956), a suffragette and rebel. The green and purple colour scheme of this year‘s directory was chosen to reflect the original suffragette campaign colours.
