		<td>In his book "The Single Helix" Steve Jones says "Creationsts have an argument not with science but with argument. .. There is no room for discussion, because the answer is written in a big book."

Bringing up children so that they don't learn to observe, question, discuss and make deductions based on evidence constricts their development and understanding of the world. Life is far too interesting and exciting to be forced into pre-determined dogmas learned by rote.

Mark Edon from the British Centre for Science Education (<a href="http://www.bcseweb.org.uk/">www.bcseweb.org.uk</a>) will be giving a presentation on the creationist movement in the UK. He will focus on the activities of certain well organised groups and their agendas for education, both open and covert. This issue is a key concern to the Humanist and Secular movements: should children's education be based on truth and evidence, or on distortion of facts for religious ends?

University Arms is 197 Brook Hill, Sheffield, S3 7HG (Sheffield University tram stop, or several buses: 51 & 52 best; 94 & 95 close by) Organised by the Sheffield Humanist Society <a href="http://www.sheffieldhumanists.org.uk/">www.sheffieldhumanists.org.uk</a></td>
