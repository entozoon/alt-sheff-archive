		<td>The Gay Icons Project runs in Sheffield through November and December. It explores the contrasting characteristics of gay iconography. The project is both an introduction to historical gay culture for non-gay audiences, and a celebration of achievement among Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered communities, experiencing empowerment in the knowledge that they live in a city, in a time where a project of this nature can now take place.

Entrance: £4, £3/ £2 (concessions)
