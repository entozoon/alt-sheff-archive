The first of what is hoped will become a regular co-ops meet up for Sheffield. Regather Co-operative hosts a social evening of informal networking to build stronger relationships between co-operatives from across Sheffield. There will be the opportunity to tell others more about your co-operative, share ideas and have a chance to meet like minded co-operators.

Agenda:
5:30pm start
5:45pm welcome and opportunity for some short presentations. Attendees can share the work of their co-operative, highlight up and coming events, pitch for why others should use products/services or appeal for assistance
6:30pm chance to relax, have a drink and talk with others
7:30pm possible after meet-up film

Free to Co-operatives UK members, Â£3.21 to non-members: <a href="http://co-operativesuk.cmail19.com/t/t-l-dhijiyk-ulkddybj-j/">tickets online</a>.
