		<td>Lansley may have got his Bill through but opposition is not going to go away.  We are not burying the NHS but still trying to save it from cuts and the attention of profit making tax avoiding companies and their friends. 

Sheffield Save Our NHS invites all who opposed the Bill to this assembly and spontaneous events - come and show your continuing dissent. We will make it short and noisy.

Bring black armbands, banners placards, music, songs, loudhailers, whatever you think will make an impact. This is an invitation to all groups, parties and individuals who have been campaigning against the Bill.
