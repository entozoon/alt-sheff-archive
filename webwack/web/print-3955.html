		<td>People can achieve so much more when they work together. Uniteâ€™s mission is for a society that places equality, dignity and respect above all else. But the union recognises it can only achieve this by bringing people together from all walks of life.

In that spirit, Unite is holding this open meeting to create strong community champions, that can fight and campaign collectively for vital community services, marginalised individuals and communities that are currently under attack.   Unite Community Membership is 50p a week and has some great benefits, such as legal help, benefits advice, and a hardship fund, plus more. Equally as important is Community Membership offering millions of voiceless people the chance to get organised and fight on issues that really affect them. The opportunity to make a difference in YOUR community and contribute to building a better more inclusive Sheffield.

In the spirit of equality everyone will be encouraged to talk about why they are at the meeting, what they expect from the union and they are free to express any experiences they wish to share.

Buses 120 or 123 from interchange. The venue has disabled access and free car parking.
