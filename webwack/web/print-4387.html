		<td>The Sheffield Kurdish community is demonstrating to oppose the repression of Kurdish demonstrators opposed to the dictatorial and corrupt Kurdish Regional Government, and protest against a recent report by an all-party group of UK MPs (including Sheffield's Meg Munn) on Kurdistan. In the words of Ali Wartty from the Kurdish community this report is 'false or in other words incredible'.

Everyone is welcome to join the demonstration and show their support for those people fighting dictatorship in the Middle East.
