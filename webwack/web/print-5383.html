		<td>Last December, Israel began a 23-day bombardment of Gaza, killing around 1,400 people. One year on, a generation of children is growing up amid the wreckage of that attack, traumatised and radicalised by the experience. 

This silent candlelit vigil is on the anniversary of the Israeli attacks on Gaza, remembering those who died and calling for an end to the siege of Gaza. Organised by Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign, supported by Sheffield Stop the War. Please bring candles if you can.
