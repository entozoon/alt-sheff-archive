Austerity is a political choice not an economic necessity, so what are the alternatives?

For decades, western governments have worked to the ideal of Margaret Thatcher&#39;s "housewife&#39;s shopping basket" analogy. That might make sense for an individual or a household, but maybe the opposite is true for a national or international economy.

* how do we make fair and sustainable use of our world&#39;s resources?
* what should be the role of politics in the economy?
* and what alternatives are there that can deliver sustained prosperity for all without busting the planet or destroying our children&#39;s future?

Donation (suggested £3) requested to cover costs.
