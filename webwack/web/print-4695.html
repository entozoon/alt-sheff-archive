		<td>Sheffield is fast becoming known as one of the top places in the world for people from the documentary and digital industries to get together - to meet, to screen their work, share knowledge, do business, make new contacts and discuss innovations and challenges they are facing in the ever changing media landscape. Oh and they allow the public to see some films!

This is the annual festival of documentaries, far too much going on to mention it all: See the website <a href="http://sheffdocfest.com/">http://sheffdocfest.com</a></td>
