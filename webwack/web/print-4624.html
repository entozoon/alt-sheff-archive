		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Gaza in my mind is a film about Musheir El-Farra's expedition with 44 peace activists from 17 countries in the attempt to break the siege of the Gaza Strip using two small and rusty boats. The expedition was organised by the Free Gaza movement, and it succeeded. These were the first two boats to enter the Gaza Strip in 41 years since the Israeli occupation of the area in 1967. Musheir managed to visit his late mother's grave for the first time. These were very emotional moments as he was denied the right to be with her during her last moments back in July 2007.

The film is directed by Fathi Jaouadi, a Tunisian film maker who submitted it as his MSc thesis at Imperial College, London. It is shown along with a longer film, <a href="http://www.justvision.org/budrus">Budrus</a>, as part of the <a href="http://www.showroomworkstation.org.uk/cinemapalestino">Cinema Palestino</a> season. Entry £5.

The Showroom are doing a £20 offer to see all Cinema Palestino films over the weekend, and the Showroom restaurant is putting on Palestinian food all the weekend with a £25 deal for a meal for two including a bottle of wine and two tickets to a film. 50% of the net profits from the season will be donated back to children's projects sponsored by <a href="http://www.sheffieldpsc.org.uk/">Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign</a></td>
