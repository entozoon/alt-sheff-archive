		<td>Sit by a wood stove in a woodland shelter, and learn about one of the oldest of all crafts. It pre-dates pottery and cloth weaving, and led to the invention of both. A course with Ray Lister, who has been making and teaching about English baskets for over 20 years, using colourful, locally-grown organic willow. Each student will craft a frame basket, even with no previous experience.
