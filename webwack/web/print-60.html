		<td>Reclaim the Power is gathering in Sheffield, saying goodbye to 2019 in style and gearing up for 2020. It’s an anti-capitalist direct action network challenging the fossil fuel industry, in the fight for social, environmental, and economic justice. A broad-based movement (anyone can join), it acts in solidarity with frontline communities to confront environmentally destructive industries, and the forces driving climate change. 

Following last year’s "Power Beyond Borders" actions against the UK’s ’hostile environment’, this gathering will think about what 2020 might look like for Reclaim the Power as a network. A great chance to join, find out what they’re all about, and help shape the plans. New people are especially welcome. The final agenda will be shared closer to the time.

Vegan meals will be provided for a small donation. Please email <a href="mailto:sheffieldcoordination@gmail.com">sheffieldcoordination@gmail.com</a> if you would need accommodation to attend.
