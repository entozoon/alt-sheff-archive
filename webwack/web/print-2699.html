		<td>ASSIST is looking forward to returning to St Marie&#39;s for a multifaith service to end 2013. People of all faiths and none are very welcome to celebrate together. This will be a family friendly, interfaith service. The ASSIST carol service is one of their most popular annual events. It provides an opportunity for asylum seekers and refugees, ASSIST supporters and volunteers to gather together to celebrate the Christmas season.

If last year&#39;s service is anything to go by, come early to get a good seat! You can stay to join in for refreshments afterwards.
