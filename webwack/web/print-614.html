		<td>The return to Sheffield of "Three Acres And A Cow" which is well worth experiencing. It connects the Norman Conquest and Peasants’ Revolt with current issues like fracking, the housing crisis and transition town and food sovereignty movements, via the Enclosures, English Civil War, Irish Land League and Industrial Revolution. 

It is a great performance, drawing a compelling narrative through the radical people’s history of Britain in folk song, stories and poems. Part talk, part history lecture, part folk club sing-a-long, part poetry slam, part storytelling session… Come and share in these tales as they have been shared for generations. Featuring Tim Ralphs, Roo Bramley and Robin Grey.

Doors open 6.30pm for a 7pm start.
