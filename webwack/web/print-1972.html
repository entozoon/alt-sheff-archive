		<td>One of the February Half Term "Childrens&#39; University" events. Who is in our community? Where did they come from? What were the buildings used for? Who makes up our community? Exploring photos and archive materials this session will discover the interesting stories and journeys of the community, and create art work or stories to add to this history.

This is an open access session on a first come first serve basis. Maximum of 15 places so if you would like to book on to secure your place email <a href="mailto:admin@igniteimaginations.org.uk">admin@igniteimaginations.org.uk</a> or call Sheff 2686813. Note if you do not arrive within 15 minutes of the start of the workshop, your place may be given away. This is free activity but aimed at those children that hold a Children’s University passport - these are easily purchased from libraries for £2. Children under 8 years must be accompanied by an adult.</td>
