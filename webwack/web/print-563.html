		<td>A Socialist Health Association event asking, if we all want to protect the NHS, what kind of NHS? We want it to be national, but surely some decisions need to be local and personal?

Entry free, (booking below), donations to the Socialist Health Association welcome. Part of this yearâ€™s <a href="https://www.festivalofdebate.com/">Festival of Debate</a>
