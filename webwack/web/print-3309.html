		<td>Showing of a historic (i.e. poor quality!) 1972 documentary film, presented by Austin Mitchell MP, about the about the "Clay Cross Rent Rebels". These were Labour district councillors who resisted an earlier generation of central government dictats. This is followed by discussion with one of the "Clay Cross 11" - Graham Skinner - about lessons for today as councils nationally set their "austerity" budgets handed down by central government.

In the last week, Derby councillors joined anti-cuts campaigners outside the Council Chamber before voting  for a cuts budget; Sheffield MPs call for a "Fair Deal" for Sheffield.

How can we build mass action against the ConDem Government and get the arguments across that there is no need for ANY cuts?

Free event, organised by <a href="http://www.unisonunleashed.wordpress.com/">Unison Unleashed</a>, (tel 07531 079268) supported by Sheffield Anti-Cuts Alliance and Sheffield Trades Union Council, information arrived at short notice.</td>
