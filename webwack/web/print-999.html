		<td>Sheffield Tent City, run by L.I.F.E. (a new beginning) is running this Breakfast Club Sunday with the simple idea that each person who comes buys a person sleeping rough a breakfast.

Sunday is known to homeless people as "Suicide Sunday" because 99% of services and charities are closed. Breakfast, on a 1 to 1 basis in a warm, comfortable environment with genuine conversation can be a life-saver to a person sleeping rough. Come along any Sunday and hear from the people themselves what it is like to be on the city streets. 

 L.I.F.E. has set up Sheffield Tent City in Park Hill Flats, as a direct response to the crisis of homelessness. 

If you cannot make it to the Breakfast Club you can donate Â£5 towards a breakfast for a person sleeping rough at their <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/2xgbmic">GoFundMe website</a>
