		<td>Is solar thermal more efficient than a ground source heat pump? What is the most cost-effective way to insulate walls? This spring Transition Caf√© event, introduces the <a href="http://www.greenhomessheffield.net/">Green Homes Sheffield</a> project to help provide some of the answers to such questions.  

As recent news items about rising gas prices and climate change causing UK flooding have illustrated, the importance of energy efficient homes and lifestyles is becoming increasingly clear. This event will help people to consider their next actions for achieving more affordable, comfortable, and future-proofed homes. The evening includes a short video about the Bath Green Homes project, and Jenny Patient, project lead for Green Homes Sheffield will describe forthcoming opportunities to visit "green homes" in Sheffield. You'll also be invited to share your questions and stories about home energy efficiency and green home improvements with other participants. If you would you be able to help Green Homes Sheffield by volunteering as a "Welcomer" on green open homes dates you would give practical help to enable the host to show their home to members of the public. Please email <a href="mailto:jenny.patient@regather.net">jenny.patient@regather.net</a> if you are interested. 

The event is free, but donations towards running costs are welcomed, and tea, coffee and light snacks will be available for purchase.
