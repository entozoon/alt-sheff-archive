		<td>Positive Money is a UK-wide organisation campaigning for monetary reform and an end to debt slavery.
They believe that the power to create money should be taken from the private banks and returned to the people to whom it properly belongs. The Sheffield group organises monthly meetings, talks, and other local events. Regular meetings on the last Monday in the month, except public holidays. Donation of £3 requested to cover the cost of the room, and £1 for tea/coffee/biscuits.
