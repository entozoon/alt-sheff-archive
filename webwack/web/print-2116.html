		<td>Hester Reeve will discuss the value of re-historicising the suffragette as a militant artist in order to celebrate the unique suffragette contribution to human rights and creative citizenship. She will also examine in detail some of the suffragettes who were also artists such as Sylvia Pankhurst, questioning why their progressive ides of art and politics are not given full merit today. 

Hester Reeve is an artist and Senior Lecturer in Fine Art at Sheffield Hallam University. She collaborates with Olivia Plender under the umbrella of The Emily Davison Lodge. Their collaborative research and artworks have been shown at the Womenâ€™s Library Gallery and Tate Britain, where they recently co-curated the Sylvia Pankhurst Display. Talk open to the public, organised by the Sheffield Humanist Society, 7.30pm for 8pm start, all welcome.
