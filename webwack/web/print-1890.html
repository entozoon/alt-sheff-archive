		<td>Contemporary politics is a funless void of austerity measures, benefits rows and zero-hours contracts. To derive humour from this is to shriek petulantly into the face of the abyss. But sometimes comedians just need to play the hand they’re given. InfoWow w/Ideological Warfare will feature Chris Coltrane (“one of a handful of comedians who are the future of British political comedy” - Mark Thomas), Tiernan Douieb (“most affable person in comedy” - The Scotsman) and many more. £5 on the door. In association with AltComCab.

Part of The Festival of Debate taking place in Sheffield in the run-up to the General election, during March and April. It provides opportunities to get together and discuss a range of issues which affect everyone. Informed decision making and strategic planning are essential for democracy, so come and get involved.
