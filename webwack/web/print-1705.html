		<td>A four day camping event on an organic farm in the Derbyshire Dales, with a vision of encouraging sustainable living. It is a festival about hope and belief in working together to make a positive change in our own lives and the lives of future generations. This is achieved by providing fun and affordable green entertainments, participatory workshops, and services powered by sustainable energy.

This year at a new site, with more organized workshops and bigger areas for kids and young people. The campaigns and crafts areas will offer positive, practical solutions to inform and empower you with ideas and new skills to take home, helping to create change. Three stages with a broad range of music and this year a new comedy, poetry and drama space. Sauna, organic cafes, bar with local ales and ciders, and healing area, dressing up space and free shop.

Northern Green Gathering has run since 1997, and is very different from the average festival, with organisers and helpers who are unpaid volunteers. Come and be part of the fun and positive force of change at Northern Green Gathering 2015.
