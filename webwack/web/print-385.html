1pm, following this, <strong>at Crucible Theatre bar</strong>, Tudor Square S1 1DA, a City of Sanctuary event to mark 70 years of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Three speakers on how human rights can help us to find a safe place to call home.

Lord Alf Dubs will be speaking about his work to protect child refugees. He came to the UK on the Kindertransport from Czechoslovakia, as part of the rescue attempt to get children to safety before the outbreak of the Second World War. He is now a Labour Peer. He has been a leading voice in Parliament and throughout the country, promoting the rights of child refugees. He set up his Childrenâ€™s Fund with the support of Safe Passage, to help young people find safe, legal routes to protection and support them in rebuilding their lives.

Sue Pearson also left Prague on the Kindertransport aged 11, to escape the invading Nazis. She made her home in Sheffield, working as a teacher and raising her family here. She recently presented a petition to Sheffield Council urging them to take in more child refugees.

Pride Mbi Agbor will speak about his work in Sheffield volunteering with groups like Student Action for Refugees, Assist and City of Sanctuary. Pride has taken his own refugee experience to try and improve the lives of people seeking asylum in Sheffield.
