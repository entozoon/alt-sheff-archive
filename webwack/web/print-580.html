		<th>Details</th>
		<td>This event, part of the Antiuniversity Now festival (9–15th June 2018) features artists, researchers and others, speaking for three to five minutes each, on the subject of "voice". How can we think about and understand voice? What does it mean to say that someone has ’found their voice’? Does voice mean the same to artists as it does to journalists or researchers? Do we all possess an ’authentic’ voice? What or who else speaks through and for us? Should we imagine and adopt the voices of others? How are voices disciplined and silenced? What voices do madness and knowledge and science and art and education speak in? 

When you book a ticket you can indicate whether you would like to speak for three to five minutes too. You don’t have to speak, but if you would like to, the organisers will send you a copy of a book called "Multivoices" in advance so that you have something to respond to. It is a script by researchers and prompted by the questions above. Some of the writers deal with problems stemming from hierarchy and power in education and research. They would like to see if this ’script’ is relevant in other areas, and don’t know what will be taught, learnt or discussed as a result of the session. It might not join up or conclude, but they hope attendees encounter enough perspectives for the questions to stay with them. 

Refreshments will be available and the event will also contain a performance of "Scissors, paper, stone" by Vulpes Vulpes.
