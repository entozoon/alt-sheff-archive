		<td>Girl Gang bring you a night of autumn food merriment. Vegan stews, a hot choccie bar where you can choose your own toppings and blankies galore. Foodhall is a community-managed open public dining room and kitchen in the city centre, serving hot meals to all on a contribute-what-you-can basis. They promote excellent values of community, diversity, skill-sharing, education, participation, equality and inclusion. As well as core opening hours for food (10am-3pm every Thursday and Friday) there are many events such as this, see the website for what else is on.

Wear warm clothing, and if you want to bring along a blanket, even better. Food is a suggested donation of £5-£10, and they would love to see you down there!
