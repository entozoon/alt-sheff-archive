		<td>All women are welcome to join this monthly vigil. This month publicising the plight of women in Palestine, joined by women from Sheffield Palestine Women's Scholarship Fund. The right to education is a fundamental human right. Israel's systematic destruction of education in the West Bank and Gaza Strip not only violates the human rights of individuals, it is an attack on the development of Palestinian society as a whole.

Women's education is under serious threat in Palestine.The current political situation, particularly in the isolated Gaza Strip, has created a new kind of poverty there. Unemployment has been growing to a point where families can no longer sustain themselves to provide the basic needs for survival. Expenses for education have become a luxury and families have been concentrating on their sons, which puts girls at a disadvantage when times are hard.
 
Following the vigil, a meeting at 3pm at the Blue Moon cafe, St James' Street (next to the Anglican cathedral) will plan the vigils for the next 3 months, including an International Women's Day vigil on Sat 6th March.
