		<td>An exhibition of posters leading up to Holocaust Memorial Day (HMD) on 27th January. The world marks this day we share the memory of the millions who have been murdered in the Holocaust and subsequent genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur, in order to challenge hatred and persecution in the UK today.

See details below, of candlelight vigil and film screening on the 27th.
