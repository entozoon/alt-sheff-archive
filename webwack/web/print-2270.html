		<td>Summer holidays are here! The regular toddler groups at Firth Park Community Allotment are making way for family playschemes for the school holidays, Thursdays 1pm-3pm on 31st July, 7th, 14th and 21st August. Activities on offer include bug hunts, flower dyes, face painting, fruit smoothies, potato day, plus the usual activities - sand tray, mud kitchen, dino park, crafts, etc.  

If you haven&#39;t visited before, the allotment site is specially designed for those with young families and is much more than a growing plot. And it has just been awarded its Green Flag status again! Firth Park Community Allotment is part of Heeley City Farm&#39;s family of growing sites. The allotment is at the meeting point of Vickers Road and Drive - just look for the big green allotment gates and follow the signs. Ring for more info: Dot 07985 421346.</td>
