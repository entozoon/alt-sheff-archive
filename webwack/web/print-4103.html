The welfare state faces massive cuts, an ideological and financial threat to working class people, whether in work or unemployed. This meeting will provide a space for organising and sharing of ideas and experiences. Much of the meeting will be open for contributions. 

A free 24-page booklet published recently by PCS arms activists with the information needed to campaign against the fierce attacks on benefits, and to put forward ideas for the future of the welfare state. It is available as text or a free download at <a href="http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/campaigns/welfare-reform/index.cfm">www.pcs.org.uk/en/campaigns/welfare-reform/index.cfm</a></td>
