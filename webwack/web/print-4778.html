		<td>Some anarchist feminists in Sheffield have created a network to share ideas, work together in direct action and join together in solidarity. They invite anyone who wishes to discuss anarchist feminist issues whether they would class themselves as anarchist feminist or not to join in at meetings or events, regardless of gender. They only require that people are respectful and reject all racist, sexist and homophobic views because this network is a liberated space.</td>
