		<td>There is a new enthusiasm for devolution to local government, but ordinary people can’t yet see how to make it happen. In this workshop we will listen to each other, talk and come up with ideas to start ‘doing devolution’ from the bottom up as soon as we walk out of the room. Organised in association with Hannah Festival.

Part of the Festival of Debate taking place in Sheffield in the run-up to the General election, during March and April. It provides opportunities to get together and discuss a range of issues which affect everyone. Informed decision making and strategic planning are essential for democracy, so come and get involved. They also welcome volunteers, from attending events and taking part in discussions to volunteering time to help run an event, promote the festival and much more. Unless otherwise stated events are free to attend, but if possible please register via the appropriate Eventbrite link on the Festival of Debate website below to give organisers an idea of numbers.
