		<td>The next Sheffield and South Yorkshire People's Assembly meeting, following the successful rally in September. This large movement is challenging low pay, zero-hours contracts and workfare, NHS and public service cuts, the bedroom tax and the whole coalition agenda of austerity. It stands for one million climate change jobs, investment and tax justice, building solidarity with strikes, welfare not warfare, countering racism, Islamophobia and the far-right.
