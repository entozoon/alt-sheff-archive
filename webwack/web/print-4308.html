		<td>The second of three events to commemorate the 63rd anniversary of the Palestinian Catastrophe, the Nakba.  Please join in remembrance of the victims of the 1948 Nakba and the victims of the ongoing Nakba for the last 63 years. 

Commemorations are being held all over the world - it has never been more important to remember the Nakba. In Israel today legislation has been passed that makes it illegal for people to organise events that use the word Nakba.
