		<td>Sheffield & Rotherham Wildlife Trust are holding this HS2 community event to ensure that, if the HS2 train line is coming to South Yorkshire, the region gets the best deal for wildlife and our local communities. The Trust is seeking views from local people to help shape their response to an environmental consultation on HS2 Phase 2b. 

Staff from the Trust will share information from the draft Environmental Statement and the likely impacts of the route on local wildlife, habitats and green space. They will be asking for comments and ideas on how to reduce or remove negative environmental impacts. The Trust opposes the development due to a lack of evidence to show a net gain for biodiversity from the proposal.

Booking for the event is essential. Free for members, Â£5 for non-members. Book online at <a href="https://www.wildsheffield.com/event/hs2">wildsheffield.com/event/hs2</a>. Attendees are asked to arrive at 6.45pm for a 7pm start. Full details at the link below.
