		<td>ASSIST provides some support to destitute asylum seekers when all the support they have been receiving from government is withdrawn following a final negative decision on an asylum claim. Not allowed to work, many become destitute, struggling daily for food, accommodation and clothing. 

ASSIST benefit concerts are fantastic events and vital fundraisers. Come and enjoy a multicultural carol concert with refreshments afterwards. Children particularly welcome.
