		<td>Storying Sheffield is an art and community project hosted at the university, in which participants learn about various aspects of narrative and place, and then produce creative representations of stories which are less likely to be heard in mainstream culture. This includes people with mental health problem and other disabilities, older people with dementia in residential care and new migrants to the UK. Come and experience films, digital artefacts, artwork, narratives and many other representations of the lives of Sheffield people, and of this major British city.
