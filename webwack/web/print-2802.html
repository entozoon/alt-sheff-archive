		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Charlie Carroll, inspired by George Orwell’s Down and Out in Paris and London, finding himself jobless, took on the daunting task of tramping from Cornwall to London, on foot with basic supplies and a commitment not to spend any money on travel or accommodation. A striking mix of travel and current-affairs writing, No Fixed Abode sheds light on a side of the UK few ever see from within.

Charlie will talk about his book and there will also be a discussion about some of the issues raised. Charlie has spoken on local and national radio and written for The Guardian and The Big Issue. You can read more about Charlie’s work at <a href="http://www.charliecarroll.co.uk/">www.charliecarroll.co.uk</a>

In collaboration with the Big Issue in the North
