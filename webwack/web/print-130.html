		<td>Dance the night away with live music by Redback and raise funds for <a href="https://www.skatepal.co.uk/">Skatepal</a> to support young people in Palestine through skateboarding, in a joint project with <a href="https://www.thehouseskatepark.co.uk/">The House Skatepark</a> in Sheffield. Indian and Palestinian snacks for sale. 

Since 2013, Skatepal has been working with communities throughout Palestine to enhance the lives of young people and promote the benefits of skateboarding, run by local and international volunteers. The project is also planning to bring young people to Sheffield in 2020 for two to four weeks for training, to be hosted by families in Sheffield, and to give public talks about their life in Palestine and the significance of skateboarding to them.
