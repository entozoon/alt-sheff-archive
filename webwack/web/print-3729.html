		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A public meeting hosted by Sheffield Stop The War Coalition with speakers including Jeremy Corbyn MP, Al Abutaleb of the NUS Black Students Campaign, and Maxine Bowler of Sheffield Anti-Cuts Alliance. The growing threats against Iran in recent weeks have been backed up with increased sanctions. As we know from Iraq, these are a prelude to war, not an alternative to it. There are signs of covert intervention already in Iran, as there are in Syria. Stop the War opposes all military intervention from the west in the region, for which there is absolutely no justification.
