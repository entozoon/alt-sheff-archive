		<td>A first group meeting for informal discussion about Basic Income, and raising awareness of the idea in Sheffield and beyond. Basic Income is the idea that everyone in society should receive a certain amount of money, enough to survive on, unconditionally. In the arguments about (and attacks on) the welfare state this idea is increasingly attracting attention from anti-poverty and equality campaigners, and some systems been tried in practice in small scale experiments.
