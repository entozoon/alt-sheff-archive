		<td>Sheffield Renewables is developing community-owned people-power kind of sustainable energy projects that will be built in Sheffield. River-water power looks set to be the first up and running in 2011/2012. If you enjoy doing something practical, you may like to help to clear out rubbish and vegetation at Kelham Island, to improve the flow in preparation for water-power.
