		<td>South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG) invites you to a public meeting with speakers from refugee and asylum rights organisations and Syrian organisations in the UK. The meeting will give facts about the worldwide refugee crisis (there are now more refugees according to the United Nations than at any time since the Second World War) and the massive scale of the Syrian refugee crisis. 

Syrian refugee families are dying in the Mediterranean desperately seeking safety in an EU country. Syrian refugees along with refugees from many countries are trapped in squalor in temporary camps around Calais trying to claim asylum in the UK. At a demonstration organised by the local Syrian community outside Leeds Home Office a tearful Syrian refugee woman explained to SYMAAG that she had been here 5 months and not even had her initial asylum interview: “No one here cares” she said.

According to the United Nations a staggering 9 million Syrians have fled their homes since the start of the uprising in March 2011. 2.5 million are in neighbouring countries, 1.1 million in Lebanon alone making up over a quarter of that country’s population. Germany and Sweden have each given refuge to tens of thousands of refugees. In June the UK had accepted just 24 under the United Nations resettlement scheme.

Come along, get the facts and join the campaign to get action on Syrian refugees. Houlden Hall is next to St Marie’s church on Norfolk Row (between Fargate and the Crucible Theatre). The meeting is 7pm-9pm but doors open at 6.30pm for refreshments. There is more information about the meeting on the South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group website.
