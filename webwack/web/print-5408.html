		<th>Date, Time & Location</th>

		<td>In response to the call-out for climate action around the world, join a candlelit walk up to Bole Hill Park in Crookes, where Chinese lanterns will be released to display support. 

Reducing carbon dioxide in the air down to 350 parts per million is simply a matter of survival. Protest on the streets and radical action can make the Copenhagen summit do this. If not, what else? 

Can you and your group help organise or publicise the event?
