		<td>South Yorkshire Refugee Law and Justice is an organisation that helps support asylum seekers to progress fresh claims for protection, and to find and communicate with lawyers. They do great work with very committed volunteers.

Sheffield Justice for All is organising a fundraising walk on Sunday 8 December to raise money towards SYRLJ&#39;s running costs. The walk will centre on High and Low Bradfield and take in local industrial and social history. It should be an enjoyable day out and they welcome anyone who would like to join in.

£10 pays for an asylum seeker&#39;s file from the Home Office, £40 for the expenses of all volunteers for a week and £3500 would cover for the rent of office space for the whole year.

If you are interested in taking part in the walk, please contact Mike McColgan on <a href="mailto:michaelmccolgan@phonecoop.coop>michaelmccolgan@phonecoop.coop</a>.

You can donate to support the walkers here: <a href="https://localgiving.com/fundraising/walkrefugees">https://localgiving.com/fundraising/walkrefugees</a></td>
