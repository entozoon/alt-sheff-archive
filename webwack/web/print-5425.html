		<td>Today is the day of The Wave, expected to be the largest demonstration on climate change yet seen in the UK, sending a message to the Government that strong action is needed at the talks in Copenhagen. Tens of thousands of people will dress in blue and flow through the streets of London to the Houses of Parliament for a 'climatic' finish at 3pm.

Chartered trains to get supporters to The Wave from the north are now <i>fully booked</i>; National Express coaches, Megabus or regular train places may still be available.

Even if you can't make it, please sign the Friends of the Earth petition at
