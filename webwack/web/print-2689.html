		<td>A social bike ride (NOT a real bus!) with interesting gift shopping opportunities. Around three hours riding, shopping and socialising. An initial itinerary is <a href="http://edgecyclists.wordpress.com/2013/11/19/christmas-shopping-thats-fun/">online here</a> so you can start your shopping list. It would be nice to have some extra people along if you can make it. 

Please notify the bus "driver" if you are coming, by email: <a href="mailto:Bikebuschris@chrisrust.net">Bikebuschris@chrisrust.net</a></td>
