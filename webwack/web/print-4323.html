		<td>A talk open to the public, organised by the Sheffield Humanist Society, all welcome. Iain Crow, Criminologist, University of Sheffield Retd, discusses what arrangements are there for protecting the public from sexual and other serious violent offenders? How do they work? What issues are raised by having in our midst people who pose a serious risk to others?

The ethical and practical problem of dealing with dangerous offenders generates a lot of heat. Iain Crow has been closely involved with the arrangements for dealing with these offenders and the protection of the public in South Yorkshire. He will use his experience to bring some light to this difficult topic.
