		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Leeds-based Filipino American Marlo De Lara is a prominent figure in a thriving and diverse international scene of female experimental music performers. As curator of the pioneering Ladyz in Noyz compilation series since 2008 she continues to promote emerging artists from around the world on her record label Corpus Callosum. 

She talks and performs about the ‘artist struggle’ in the context of current political unrest and socio-historical gender barriers. As she explains: "The work of making art is more critical than ever to the individual and the social body. It nourishes our emotionally exhausted souls by allowing another method to exist and create. Sharing and talking about surviving these tumultuous times feeds the community of individually suffering marginalized peoples. In this way, it is a revolutionary act and a survival method. We must live through this. We must create. We must commune with others and extend our selfcare to the larger community."

Free/£3.50 solidarity tickets.
