		<td>Pride Sheffield is the largest LGBT+ event in South Yorkshire. It brings together the lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and non-binary community and their friends, families and allies. Uplifting live music, DJs, beer tent, and loads of stalls and entertainment throughout the afternoon, activities and loads to do for young and old alike.  

The daytime event will be free to attend and open to all, at Endcliffe Park. There will also be a ticketed after-party at Sheffield University to contribute towards the costs of putting on the daytime event.

The Pride march will take place from the city centre, along Ecclesall Road to the main festival site at Endcliffe Park. The march is free for individuals and voluntary organisations. (A fee is payable for float/vehicle entries and commercial organisations.)

Pride Sheffield is a not for profit organisation entirely run by volunteers. It costs in excess of Â£20k to put on, a lot of hard work behind the scenes to raise the funds. Pride could not run the event without volunteers. If you are able to spare a few hours on the day and would like to help out please click "Get Involved" on the website (training and lunch provided).
