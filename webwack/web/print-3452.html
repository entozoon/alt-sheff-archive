		<td>It&#39;s one year since the Sheffield Positive Money group first got together. It has tripled in size since then, so this is a great opportunity for everyone to come and meet other people who believe in the democratisation of the nation&#39;s money supply.

Positive Money believes that the power to create money should be taken from the private banks and returned to the people to whom it properly belongs.

On the agenda is a review of the past year, and vision for the future, how to explain Positive Money in 5 minutes to a friend or neighbour - discussion/workshop. Also a presentation on the myth of Fractional Reserve Banking, and Open Forum until 9pm.

Meet from 6:45 for a chat over tea/coffee, then the meeting will start at 7pm. Voluntary donation of £3 to cover costs, tea/coffee £1.
