		<td>Sheffield City Council (SCC) have been working with Immigration Enforcement to report people they describe as "illegal immigrants". The Private Housing Standards team of SCC has received <a href="https://issuu.com/nowthensheffield/docs/nt139web-singlepages/4">large grants from the UK Government Controlling Migration Fund, (covered by Alt-Sheff in <i>Now Then</i> magazine this month)</a>. Freedom of Information requests and information on the SCC website reveal that it has been doing this for 3 years in our "City of Sanctuary".

South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG) and many others have challenged the SCC actions with protests and questions to demand that SCC defies the "hostile environment" as other councils have done, as it puts lives at risk. A SCC Scrutiny Committee will discuss this issue on Thursday 24th October at 5pm. All are welcome to attend and speak. Join SYMAAG to demand that Sheffield is a city of sanctuary, not a hostile environment for undocumented migrants.
