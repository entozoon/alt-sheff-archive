		<td>Women in Black is a world-wide network of women committed to peace with justice and actively opposed to injustice, war, militarism and other forms of violence. As women experiencing these things in different ways in different regions of the world, they support each other's movements. An important focus is challenging the militarist policies of our own governments. 

They are not an organisation, but a means of communicating and a formula for action. Any group of women anywhere in the world at any time may organize a Women in Black vigil, and Sheffield Women in Black holds a vigil on the 1st Saturday of every month at the War Memorial.
