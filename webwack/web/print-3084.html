		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Join Phil, bird expert, on an annual early morning bird walk and see which of our feathered friends are making their home on the Farm this year. The delayed warmer weather means there is a flurry of nest building activity and the diverse terrains on the Farm means there will be plenty of different birds to see. 

Meet outside The Farm Kitchen at 5.30am. Phil will take a leisurely walk around the different areas of the Farm, finish time is approximately 7.30am. Some areas may be unsuitable for those with mobility problems etc but alternative routes are available.

Phone Sheff 2580482 for more details. <a href="http://www.heeleyfarm.org.uk/">Heeley City Farm</a> is 20 mins walk from Sheffield, Bus 33 or 47.</td>
