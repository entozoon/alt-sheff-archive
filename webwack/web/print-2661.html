		<td>The Socialist Equality Party (UK) is hosting a memorial meeting for Dave Hyland, its former national secretary, who died in December, aged 66. The meeting will centre on an examination of the significance of the political fight he undertook when he declared a minority in support of the International Committee of the Fourth International, opposing those factions of the old Workers Revolutionary Party (WRP) that were seeking to destroy the world Trotskyist movement. 

A platform of international speakers will include David North, national chairman of the Socialist Equality Party of the United States, and chairman of the International Editorial Board of the <a href="https://www.wsws.org/">World Socialist Web Site</a>. North played the leading political role in defending the continuity of Trotskyism and opposing its betrayal by the WRP.

Tickets for the meeting (£5 waged/£2.50 unwaged) available at <a href="http://www.socialequality.org.uk/">www.socialequality.org.uk</a></td>
