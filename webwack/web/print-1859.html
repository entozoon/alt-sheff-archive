		<td>The NHS is in crisis, but the problem isnâ€™t only due to lack of funding. Jillian Creasy has worked as a GP in Sheffield for 25 years and has been a city councillor for ten years. She will lead a discussion about the changes which are needed to improve health and health care, as well as reducing demand.

The Festival of Debate is taking place in Sheffield in the run-up to the General election, during March and April. It provides opportunities to get together and discuss a range of issues which affect everyone. Informed decision making and strategic planning are essential for democracy, so come and get involved. They also welcome volunteers, from attending events and taking part in discussions to volunteering time to help run an event, promote the festival and much more. Unless otherwise stated events are free to attend, but if possible please register via the appropriate Eventbrite link on the Festival of Debate website below to give organsisers an idea of numbers.
