		<td>Jill Evans, MEP for Wales, has visited the West Bank and is working with other MEPs to act in support of Palestinians. There has been an EU report that in effect treats the illegal Israeli settlements as outside Israel. This has caused alarm in some quarters of Israel. Jill will explain the current position taken by the EU and its impact.  

A public meeting run by Sheffield Palestinian Solidarity Campaign, which campaigns to get shops like Sainsburys to put their claims to support farming justice into practice, asking customers not to buy Israeli goods and Sainsburys not to sell them.
