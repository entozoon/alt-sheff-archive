	<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="20">
	<tr>
		<th>Date, Time & Location</th>
		<td>Mon 6 Nov 2017, 7.30pm,  Quaker Meeting House, 10 St James St. S1 2EW</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Nationally and internationally, the Positive Money Campaign is steadily persuading people of the need to change the disastrous way that money is created for the economy, primarily via private banks. Positive Money proposes that private banks should lose this function, and that money should be created centrally and democratically for the good of all, not just the rich.

At this meetup, the Sheffield "Core Team" will introduce themselves, and host a discussion on how best to achieve objectives and grow the movement locally. Whatever your interest: crises, debt, inequality, house price inflation, banking in the future....  come along and participate in the debate!

They ask for voluntary donations up to Â£5 to help cover costs</td>
