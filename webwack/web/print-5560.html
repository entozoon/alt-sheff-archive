		<td>Abundance is a project to harvest the seasonal glut of local fruit like apple, pear and plum. Each year hundreds of fruit trees go unpicked either because people donâ€™t notice them, may not be physically able to harvest them or there are just too many fruits at one time.

Abundance is a team of volunteers who have been helping harvest city fruit and redistributing the surplus to the community on a non-profit basis - to community cafes, nurseries, Surestarts and individuals.

Abundance also juices tonnes of fruit and make jams, pickles and preserves. Fruit juicing will be led by Daniele Rinaudo, an Abundance volunteer. A hand powered press, electrical juicer and other essential equipment will be available to use. Juicing will be done outside, but undercover - so whatever the weather we'll be juicing! They have a supply of apples, but if you can it would fantastic to bring a bag of locally harvested apples, pears, plums etc. to juice.
