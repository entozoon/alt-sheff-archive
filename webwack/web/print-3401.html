		<td>Society tolerates road death and disability as an acceptable price to pay for increased motorisation and convenience. Crashes are still seen as unfortunate "accidents", instead of preventable collisions. The World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims was introduced by RoadPeace in 1993, and spread to other European countries, before being adopted by the United Nations in 2005. Since then, over 55,000 people have died on Britainâ€™s roads. 1 in 75 of us is bereaved through a road crash.
