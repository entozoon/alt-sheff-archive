		<th>Details</th>
		<td>This new documentary is being screened as we pass through the 30th anniversary of the historic 1984-85 Miners&#39; Strike. South Yorkshire was heavily affected and the strike was widely supported. It was prompted by a deliberately savage mass closure of coal mines by the Thatcher government, deeply damaging communities dependent on them. The official reason was low profitability, but it was later proved to have been a pre-planned neoliberal attack on nationalised industry, and the power of the highly organised and left-wing National Union of Mineworkers. This moving documentary, by Bad Bonobo films, includes previously unreleased material from the time. It was the Audience Award Winner at Sheffield Docfest.

For tickets callÂ Ian Evers 01709 854074. Silverwood is fairly close to Rotherham town centre, on a main road accessible by public transport. There are other showings at various venues, for example see 30th January.
