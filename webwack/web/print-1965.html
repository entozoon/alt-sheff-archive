		<td>"Time To Act" is a series of climate change creative events around the 2015 People&#39;s Climate March (details below, see 7th March). Be part of the growing movement for the sake of our future, climate has to be at the top of every political agenda. Join in with the willow sculpture and banner-making sessions throughout February (all details shown on Alt-Sheff)

This workshop is for making willow sculptures, working with the people who organise lantern making for Sharrow Festival. You can make an individual structure or join in with the large structure building. (Also anyone can learn the climate song: singing sessions are at 1.30 and 3pm.) They would appreciate Â£2 donation towards materials.
