		<td>South Yorkshire Greenpeace highlights local, national and international environmental issues and discusses how to effectively campaign in a positive way, as a local group, whilst supporting the Greenpeace organisation as a whole. They welcome all people from the South Yorkshire area who would like to get involved.

Meetings are fun and informal, with lots of laughs and perhaps a few pints of beer to enjoy the evening with too, so please do come along.
