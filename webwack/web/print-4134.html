		<td>Autumn is here and to celebrate the people are gathering at the Leopard pub in Doncaster for a day and night of frolics, fun, food and creativity at the first ever HARFEST. This is a DIY event involving bread making, survival skill-sharing, seed swapping, campaign talks and info, music, films, food and beer. The Leopard will become a temporary autonomous art space beginning Sunday and everyone is invited to bring whatever they can, be it yourself, an instrument or some acorns to light up the space and have a great time. 

This is an opportunity to come together and use a community space before it becomes another empty building.
