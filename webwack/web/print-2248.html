Run by Low Impact Living Initiative (LILI) which offers publications, free factsheets, a huge database and forum, products, services and courses in everything from co-operatives to wildfood camping. In Sheffield, courses are often held at the Woodland Discovery Centre, an educational facility in the largest ancient woodland in South Yorkshire. Full course details are on the LILI website. Although not free, they are run by experts, giving in-depth tuition in less common skills.
