		<td>Banner Theatre performance of "Rise Like Lions" is coming to Sheffield. It is described as a political kaleidoscope of working class struggles with humour and music - folk, reggae and ska. A celebration of grassroots resistance to those intent on tearing apart our welfare state, ripping up our environmental protections and imposing ever more draconian misery on millions. 

"Rise, Like Lions" weaves inspirational stories of workers in struggle with music, song and video. The show exposes a 30-year plot to privatise the NHS and the fight to keep it in public hands. It stages the successful strikes of teaching support staff in Derby and Durham, and the massive campaign waged by unions and parents against the cuts to school budgets. The lively anti-fracking campaigns which have sprung up across the country are interlaced into the narrative, through the stories of those who lead them: local communities and trade unions, angry at the Tories’ destructive policies and incensed by their blatant disregard for local democracy. 

"We need Banner’s anti-cuts, anti-tax dodgers and pro-union productions to raise awareness and challenge the myths propagated by the corporate media" said Mark Serwotka, General Secretary, PCS Union. Switch off the fake news and tune in to the real news from Banner Theatre!

Doors and bar open 6.45pm, start time: 7.30pm. Ticket price: £8 waged / £4 concessions. To reserve tickets please email <a href="mailto:tucsheffield@gmail.com">tucsheffield@gmail.com</a>.  The production is supported by Sheffield Trade Union Council and the NUT, Unison, Unite, USDAW and PCS unions.</td>
