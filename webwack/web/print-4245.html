		<td>Jon Ronson, documentary maker and award-winning writer of  bestsellers Them: Adventures with Extremists and The Men Who Stare at Goats will be talking about his latest book The Psychopath Test (due for publication June 2011). 

Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. Talks are typically about a common belief that can be demonstrated to be false or cannot be justified by the available evidence. The events are free though they ask for a Â£2 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
