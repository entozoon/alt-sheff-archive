		<td>The Cuban revolution is almost universally understood as the victory of a guerrilla army, in which workers and their organisations were passive onlookers. Stephen Cushion presents a talk about his 2016 book "A Hidden History of the Cuban Revolution: How the Working Class Shaped the Guerrillas’ Victory" which turns this conventional wisdom on its head. Based on years of research he argues that the Cuban working class played a much more decisive role in the Revolution’s outcome than previously understood.
