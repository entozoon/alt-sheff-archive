		<td>South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG) unites refugee, asylum and migrant organisations with campaign groups and supporting individuals. It campaigns both for the rights of those seeking asylum and of those coming to work in this country. This working group is monitoring the actions of the G4S corporation, placed in charge of housing asylum seekers in our region, despite its appalling record of human rights violations.
