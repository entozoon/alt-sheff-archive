		<td>Fracking will only add to climate change chaos, pollution and destruction. Fracking also causes unacceptable disturbance to the local area, with vastly increased heavy traffic, noise and flaring. 

No Fracking Day will be marked by solidarity marches that will unite in a 2pm rally at <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Main+Rd,+Marsh+Lane,+Sheffield+S21+5RH/@53.3072449,-1.3955346,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48799c9771a2d32f:0xeeb5fa9e6e35b6fd!8m2!3d53.307822!4d-1.3917397?hl=en">Bramleymoor Lane</a near Sheffield>, where there is a proposed drilling site. This is followed by live music at 4pm at the Fox & Hounds nearby.

Join the march to oppose the proposed rig at Marsh Lane.
