		<td>A lunchtime brainstorm to think of ways in which individuals and small groups can make refugees and asylum seekers welcome in the city. Sheffield City of Sanctuary would like to hear what you're doing already, and help you think of new ideas to put into an illustrated booklet to be published at the end of this Summer of Sanctuary. Please come along for three minutes or the full three hours to help create this showcase of Yorkshire welcome.

Lunch will be provided to help you chew over your ideas.
