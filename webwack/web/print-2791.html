		<td>Banks, hedge funds and pension funds based in Britain are bankrolling the extraction of fossil fuels all over the world. Many of these dirty energy projects are wrecking communities and fuelling climate change while doing nothing to increase energy access for local people. Join WDM (World Development Movement) to demand energy justice. See more at: <a href="http://www.wdm.org.uk/events/carbon-capital-speaker-tour">www.wdm.org.uk/events/carbon-capital-speaker-tour</a>

From 20th to 31st October, WDM local groups across the UK will be hosting guests from Colombia and Indonesia who are involved in opposing the expansion of open-cast coal mining in their countries. WDM Sheffield will be hosting their meeting on Wednesday 30th October, and the speakers will be:

Hendrik Sirengar, the co-ordinator of JATAM, the Indonesian mining advocacy network which works with communities affected by mining.

Kirsty Wright from WDM, explaining the role of the Carbon Capital campaign in reigning in this dirty energy production.

This event is free and open to all.
