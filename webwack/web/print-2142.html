		<td>Peter Verity, coordinator of the Sheffield group of Positive Money supporters, gives this talk, "Debunking Banking". We know that banks "create money out of thin air", and we are campaigning to "democratise money and banking", but what does that really mean? Peter goes back to basics and debunks some widely held myths.

• What is money and where does it come from?
• What makes a bank balance sheet so special?
• What is Fractional Reserve Banking? - does it really exist, and what are Reserves anyway?
• What role - if any - would banks have in a reformed system? 
• And what do we need a Central Bank for?

Positive Money ask for a donation of £3 per head to cover costs. This meetup is for everyone interested in how the money system works and how it could be changed to be constructive and socially beneficial. Come and feel free to invite your friends who might be interested too. Everyone is welcome!
