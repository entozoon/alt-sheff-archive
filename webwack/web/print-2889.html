		<td>40 years ago a military coup plunged Chile into a brutal right-wing dictatorship, the first country in the world to experience the shock of "neoliberalism". Many fled the country, some arriving here to make Sheffield their new home. 

Now, in commemoration of the anniversary, there is a series of events including this tree planting in memory of José Amigo, Alan Rodríguez and Humberto Reyes, compañeros exiled in Sheffield and Yorkshire who were killed by the security forces when they went back to Chile.
