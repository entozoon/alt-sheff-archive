		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A documentary about Marco Pantani, the most flamboyant and popular cyclist of his era, who won both the Tour de France and Giro d’Italia – a titanic feat of physical and mental endurance that no rider has repeated since. He was a hero to millions – the saviour of cycling following the doping scandals which threatened to destroy the sport. However, less than six years later, aged just 34, he died alone, in a cheap Italian hotel room. Combining scintillating race archive with contemporary news footage, stylised reconstructions, and interviews with Pantani’s friends, family, colleagues, and rivals, including Sir Bradley Wiggins, Evgeni Berzin and Greg LeMond. The story of the greatest climber of his generation; man versus mountain, athlete versus the system, Marco Pantani versus himself.

Tickets: £6 without coffee/tea/cake (or £8 with coffee/tea/cake)
