		<td>At the time of writing, the numbers slaughtered in Gaza by Israel are close to 1900, 80% of them civilians, including over 300 children. Over 9000 Palestinians have been injured. Thousands of buildings have been turned to rubble, including hospitals, schools, power stations and UN centres sheltering refugees. If you believe the BBC and other &#39;mainstream&#39; media you will not know how massive is the international wave of revulsion and protest. 

In London today there is a <a href="http://stopwar.org.uk/events/august-9-national-demonstration-for-gaza-no-excuses-be-there#.U97Tn4-ycxD">National Demonstration for Gaza organised by Stop the War</a>, coaches are available from Rotherham at 7.30 and Sheffield at 8am. Tickets Â£20 waged, from Maxine - text: 07946 660266 or 07753 324055.

If you cannot travel to London, join the Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign <a href="http://us6.campaign-archive1.com/?u=e9f7e3f515cf87277529f8b0f&amp;id=58990215f8&amp;e=a353a675b6">protest outside the Town Hall at noon</a>. 

Demonstrations may not seem enough, but one of the few things giving hope to Palestinians in Gaza is seeing and hearing about the hundreds of thousands of people protesting on the streets against Israel&#39;s onslaught. Please maintain your support - the people of Palestine need you more than ever.
