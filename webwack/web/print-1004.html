		<td>For UN Universal Children’s Day, an action workshop day on Profiting from Children in Prison: G4S and Outsourcing.

Speakers:
<ul><li>Carolyne Willow, children’s rights campaigner and author of "Children Behind Bars", she assisted on the Panorama exposure of G4S-run Medway children’s prison, where children were coerced, degraded and bullied.</li><li>Clare Sambrook, investigative journalist for <a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/">OpenDemocracy.net</a>, and one of the founders of End Child Detention, seeking to stop children being imprisoned in Immigration Detention Centres</li><li> Eric Allison, prison correspondent of the Guardian since 2003, who was in a children’s prison at age 14</li><li>Kiri Tunks, Defence for Children International Palestine (DCIP), campaigning for Palestinian children’s rights, who collects evidence and advocates for children detained, mistreated and tortured in Israeli prisons.</li></ul>
G4S is the largest security and military company in the world with over 600,000 employees. It lost the Medway contract and is selling its other children’s homes and children’s prisons contracts, but it still has contracts for juvenile wings in its government funded private prisons. G4S has contracts in Israel securing children’s prisons. 440 children under 18 are currently held in military detention, almost two-and-half times the number imprisoned a year ago. <a href="https://electronicintifada.net/tags/defence-children-international-palestine-section">According to the DCIP</a>, no other country in the world systematically prosecutes hundreds of children in military courts each year.

G4S provides squalid housing conditions for asylum seekers throughout Yorkshire. It manages immigration detention centres, and health services at the notorious Yarls Wood centre for women. The security and military company has just been awarded the contract to run an official equalities help service for the government.

Admission free (room hire and refreshments donations welcome). Organised by <a href="http://www.sheffieldpsc.org.uk/">Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign</a> in partnership with <a href="http://www.symaag.org.uk/">South Yorkshire Migration And Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG)</a></td>
