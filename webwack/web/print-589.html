		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The Socialist Equality Party (UK) and the International Youth and Students for Social Equality are holding a series of meetings titled: "War, lies and censorship — For the building of a socialist anti-war movement!" The drive to war and dictatorship can only be stopped by merging working class opposition to social inequality, with the struggle against imperialism.

In the wake of the US-British-French missile strikes on Syria, it´s clear that the imperialist powers will not be satiated without further bloodshed. A campaign is growing in the political and military/intelligence establishments in the UK and US for a wider war that would threaten a nuclear conflict with Russia. These war preparations are propelled by more than soldiers and missiles: they are powered by lies. All the major news outlets are working overtime to sell the public a re-hash of the “weapons of mass destruction” narrative used to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq. This propaganda exhibits contempt for both the truth, and the intelligence of the public. After 25 years of endless war, millions of people have become deaf to the hysterical and hypocritical allegations used by the imperialists to dress up their designs against weak countries as a saintly mission for the liberation of mankind.

The ruling elite knows there is mass opposition to their criminal designs. The first months of 2018 have seen an immense escalation of class conflict around the world in opposition to the relentless assault on workers’ jobs, living standards and democratic rights. This is the real source of the campaign for internet censorship. Under the bogus cover of “fake news” and “Russian meddling,” the government aims to suppress and criminalise resistance to war and austerity.
