		<td>Positive Money is campaigning for radical reform of ‘high street’ (or retail) banking. But much larger sums are traded (hundreds of trillions of dollars daily) in the global investment (or wholesale) banking sector. This is where the world’s too-big-to-fail banks make most of their gross profit. This is where bad debt still lurks within the system. This is what is driving the present crisis.

        The Positive Money tactic of focussing on reforming the ‘high street’ is very sensible. Difficult as it is to get one’s head around the basics of money creation, the world of global finance, derivatives,  speculation and so on, is bigger and even more complicated. 
         
        This talk will be given by Dermot, a member of the Sheffield Positive Money group. 50p charge for refreshments, and voluntary donation (suggested £3) to cover costs.
