		<td>Festival of Debate Question Time is a postcard and online project, organised by Sheffield Equality Group. The project aims to gather answers to four questions from across the city, as well as at Festival of Debate events. Selected cards will form an exhibition, as well as being on the project <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fodqt">Facebook page</a>, where you can post a response or reflection â€“ written, drawn, video, audio, photos or videos.

The questions are:
<strong>
What 3 values should be at the heart of being British? 
What makes you fulfilled? 
Is food a human right or should it be earned?
What is the most expensive thing you own?  </strong>

Part of Festival of Debate. Sheffield is an active and engaged city. In the past it has been instrumental in national politics, with activism by workers, students and communities. The Festival of Debate has become part of this ongoing history, as it enters its third year with a season for spring 2017. Events include panel discussions, debates, Q&As, artistic responses and keynote speeches, at various venues. It is hosted by not-for-profit social enterprise <a href="http://www.opusindependents.com/">Opus Independents</a> (which also publishes a monthly Alt-Sheff column in <a href="http://nowthenmagazine.com/sheffield/">Now Then magazine</a>).
