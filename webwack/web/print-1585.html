		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Sheffield Climate Alliance is an alliance of local organisations and individuals who are pressing for effective action to tackle climate change. The network is hosted by Sheffield Campaign against Climate Change and a growing list of organisations that participate. They meet on the third Tuesday of each month.

They are currently campaigning to stop more extraction of fossil fuels and instead switch investment to making our homes and city more energy-saving – bringing thousands of useful jobs. In the run-up to the critical Paris climate talks in 2015 it’s ‘Time to Act!’ – write to your MP and join on Sat 28 November at the ‘Time for the Climate’ event in Sheffield and in London on Sun 29 November for the People’s March for Climate, Jobs and Justice, or maybe even in Paris on Sat 12th December!
