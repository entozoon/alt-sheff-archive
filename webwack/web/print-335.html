		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Celebrated by Noam Chomsky, and originally blacklisted in the USA for being subversive, Salt of the Earth tells the true story of the wives of striking zinc miners in New Mexico, and is performed by those who took part in it. A real life documentary, not simply left-wing morality or “communist propaganda”. It covers tensions between the strikers, white and Mexican, and the women they struggle to see as equal. 

New Roots Radical Library are running this event in collaboration with the University of Sheffield Students Union Film Unit. Tickets £2 from the link below.
