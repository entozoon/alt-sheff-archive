		<td>Sheffield is to have a bike festival !! Sat 19 June 2010 on Devonshire Green !!

The plans are from a group of individuals who wish to organise the festival on a voluntary basis. The group is committed to an open and inclusive process.

<b>3pm meeting for cycling organisations</b>
They would really like to include all the cycling organisations in Sheffield to be a part of the festival, so come and find out what's been talked about so far. There is still lots of scope for new ideas and possibilities, bring anything you can think of!

<b>7pm meeting for non-cycling organisations </b>
There will be another meeting held for non-cycling organisations at the same location, on the same day, at 7pm. You would be very welcome to come to this meeting if you can't make the earlier one
