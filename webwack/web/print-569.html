		<td>In an age where social media is more popular than the pub, church, temple or mosque for social interaction, how and where do you meet your neighbours? Do we want to know our neighbours? What does your new neighbour need to know? What does it take to be a good neighbour? And is it your role to tell them about your neighbourhood? A panel will be exploring these complex topics, featuring local councillors and members of the community with lived experience.

A free event, part of Festival of Debate 2018.
