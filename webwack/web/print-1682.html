		<td>Come and enjoy LibFest, a grassroots community music festival. A variety of live music and DJs, food and drink throughout the day. Stalls and workshops run by various groups.
<strong>
LibFest presents a positive alternative to austerity policies following the general election result and in response to the worsening economic conditions for working people. A day of solidarity and hope, connecting diverse communities concerned about the direction our society is taking. It will be an opportunity for the people of Sheffield to meet like-minded folk, exchange ideas and celebrate progressive models for running our communities and workplaces, and the fact that there are masses of people across our city working for positive changes to our lives. 

If your organisation would like to help by publicising, attending, or making the event as good as possible through running a stall and/or workshop or anything else, contact the organisers. Printed and online publicity is available to distribute.
</strong>
Bring your own alcohol – but please note this is a community and child-friendly event, so alcohol consumption kept to a reasonable level.
