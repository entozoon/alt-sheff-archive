		<td>Merazonia is a wildlife rescue and rehabilitation centre in Ecuadorian rainforest, founded in 2004. They care for primates, sloths, felines, parrots, otters and other animal victims of the illegal pet trade and deforestation. Their aim is to return them to the wild as soon as possible.

This festival, in the UK for the very first time, has live music, informative talks, local stalls, delicious food, local craft beers and so much more! Tickets are available to book online and all proceeds will benefit Merazonia directly. Hathersage is under 20 minutes by train from Sheffield.
