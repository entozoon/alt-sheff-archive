		<td>An invitation to share a meal, and then to make a donation, to fund raise for <a href="http://www.assistsheffield.org.uk/">Assist</a>. This is the Sheffield-based charity that tries to look after asylum seekers and to make sure, amongst other services, that those who cannot go back home but also are not allowed to work or claim benefit (i.e. are effectively destitute) receive some small amount of money each week to feed themselves. 
 
Buffet lunch including a glass of wine: donation of Â£18. Vegetarians catered for. Other diets please enquire in advance. Note there are other dates available: see 15th and 23rd March.
