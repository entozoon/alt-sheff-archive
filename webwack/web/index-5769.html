	<p class="message">Sheffield for Democracy is concerned about the effectiveness of the various Scrutiny Committees operated by Sheffield City Council. Scrutiny is an important function: the oversight of public bodies. Local authorities have a statutory duty to have an effective Scrutiny process, open to the public. They are monitoring how the various Scrutiny Committees in Sheffield City Council operate, with a view to suggesting  improvements. This means sitting in, and sometimes asking questions.     
<br><br> 
There is also a concern that the welcome and facilities of the meetings deter public engagement and attendance. Sheffield for Democracy are pressing for improved facilities for public involvement in these open meetings. They would like to see microphones so the public can hear what is being said and by whom, and a better room layout so people can see faces rather than backs of heads.  Ultimately, they would like to see Webcasting to a wider audience, which is already available in some venues.  
<br><br>
 Sheffield for Democracy have been focusing on Sheffield City Council, but are now also looking at the City Region Combined Authority, and the South Yorkshire Police & Crime Panel, which have their own Scrutiny arrangements
 <br><br>
To gather some evidence on this matter they need your help. Between now and May, they want to gain more opinions on how the committees work. Their Scrutiny Working Group is not large enough to visit all the scrutiny committee meetings. Can you help? Would you be able and willing to attend one of these meetings, and to feed back what you think?
  <br><br>
For a feedback form and details of the different meetings contact Sheffield for Democracy or check the <a href="http://sheffielddemocracy.moderngov.co.uk/mgCalendarMonthView.aspx?GL=1&amp;bcr=1">calendar each month, online here</a>. 
<br><br>
Sheffield City Region Combined Authority Overview & Scrutiny Committee (next meetings 3 March at 2pm; 28 April 2pm) meets in Regent St., Barnsley, with <a href="http://meetings.southyorks.gov.uk/ieListMeetings.aspx?CId=383&amp;Year=0&amp;zTS=B">details on their website</a>. This is webcast. There are background documents to read if you plan to attend, see section 9 at <a href="http://sheffieldcityregion.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Sheffield-CR-Assurance-Framework-Part-1-APPROVED.pdf">this link</a>  
<br><br>
The Police and Crime Commissioner is monitored through its Police and Crime Panel. This is made up of elected councillors from Sheffield, Rotherham, Doncaster and Barnsley, plus 2 independent members (next meetings: 4 March; 15 April at 11am). It is usually chaired by a councillor from Sheffield.  The "host authority", funded by the Home Office, is Rotherham MB Council. Panel meetings are held in Rotherham Town Hall, and webcasts of panel meetings are both live and then archived in their library. Panel meetings are open to the public, who can submit appropriate questions in advance.  The PCC and his staff are usually present to give immediate answers. The venue has excellent facilities for public involvement. See <a href="https://moderngov.rotherham.gov.uk/ieListMeetings.aspx?XXR=0&amp;Year=2015&amp;CId=937&amp;MD=ielistmeetings">the RMBC website</a>
<br><br>
 <a href="http://www.cfps.org.uk/">The Independent Centre for Public Scrutiny</a> has useful advice on its website. 
<br><br>
With your feedback, Sheffield for Democracy can begin to assess the performance of the various committees. Please contact them if you are able to attend any of these scrutiny meetings over the next 3 months, it would be really helpful if you could complete a feedback sheet, and preferably return it electronically. Your help will be really valuable and inform their ability to hold these public bodies to account, and improve their processes. Alan Kewley and Nigel Slack have been activists in this area of work; you may come across them at the meetings. Do introduce yourself
