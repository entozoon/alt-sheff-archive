Includes an excellent talk on "Designing Quality Of Life Into The City: Why Sheffield Should Go Dutch", explaining how the Dutch approach of designing freedom to move into their urban spaces affords families a quality of life and freedom which is the envy of Europe.

Prepare to be educated, inspired and ready to push for change in Sheffield! Food and drink available from the bar throughout the evening.
