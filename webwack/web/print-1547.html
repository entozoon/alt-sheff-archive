		<td>ASSIST Sheffield is currently the only Sheffield charity focused on destitution among asylum seekers. They provide accommodation, food and support, advance the education of the public and other organisations, in order to assist the inclusion of asylum seekers into the wider community, and raise awareness about the plight of asylum seekers in our city.

This session allows newcomers to meet current volunteers, find out more about the different volunteer roles, chat about what might suit you, and apply to be a volunteer. Please note the same presentation will be repeated twice, at 10 minutes past each hour (at 16:10 & 17:10), so choose the one that is best for you.

To find out more, phone Sheff 2754960 or email <a href="mailto:volunteer@assistsheffield.org.uk">volunteer@assistsheffield.org.uk</a>
