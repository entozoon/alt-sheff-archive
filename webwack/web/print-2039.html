		<td>The first Repair Cafe of the new year!

Got a broken household item that need fixing but you don&#39;t know how? Don&#39;t throw it away! Bring it along to Repair Sheffield&#39;s Repair Cafe and volunteer fixers will take a look and see if they can work their magic on it. Small electrical items, shoes, scales, toys, tools and wooden furniture are just some of the items that can be brought along, and that have been successfully fixed at previous cafes. Fixers will show you how to mend and pass on valuable knowledge which will enable you to do things for yourself, or go in to a repair shop with enough know-how to feel confident of getting the job done properly.

Sheffield has one of the worst rates of recycling/re-use in the country so let&#39;s change that this year.

Heeley City Farm is 20 mins walk from Sheffield. The event is held in the Community Room by the pond at Heeley City Farm. ALSO in the room Common Thread doing a hat and scarf swap! This event is free but they gratefully welcome donations to cover materials, if people are able, as the project has no funding. For more info contact Sheff 2580482 option 5, or email Gordon on <a href="mailto:gordon.ferguson@phonecoop.coop">gordon.ferguson@phonecoop.coop</a>
