		<td>All women are welcome to join the vigil which is protesting about the treatment of lesbian and gay people who are claiming asylum on grounds of sexuality. Despite the fact that homosexuality is illegal in 80 countries and is punishable by death in 7, the UK does not guarantee protection to lesbians and gays facing persecution in their own countries.

There is a letter for people to send to Damian Green, Minister for Immigration, asking that asylum regulations are clarified to protect this group of vulnerable people.

There is also a letter to be sent to the President of South Africa calling for the  crime of (so-called) 'corrective rape' of lesbians to be deemed a hate crime and for this crime to be treated seriously by both the police and judiciary.
