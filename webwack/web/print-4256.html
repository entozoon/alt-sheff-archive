		<td>On the longest Friday of the year, Friday Night Ride (FNR) will be kicking off Bike Week for CycleSheffield. The theme of this ride is Free Love and Socialism: a ride to see the Millthorpe house where <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Edward_Carpenter">Edward Carpenter</a> (nationally and internationally renowned radical, socialist activist, writer and thinker, advocate of free love, early gay activist, 'bohemian' and sandalmaker) lived from the 1880s to the 1920s.

Wear some sandals; the other stuff is optional! It's FNRâ€™s 3rd birthday so bubbly and snacks too. Pub stop at Millthorpe or thereabouts. More info: <a href="http://www.edwardcarpenter.net/ecbiog.htm">www.edwardcarpenter.net</a>. There is a campaign to raise funds to put up a memorial/statue in Sheffield in recognition of Carpenter and his work and influence: <a href="http://www.friendsofedwardcarpenter.co.uk/">www.friendsofedwardcarpenter.co.uk</a> and Sheila Rowbotham: 'Edward Carpenter: a life of liberty and love' London, Verso 2008 and David Price: 'Sheffield Troublemakers: Rebels and Radicals in Sheffield History' Chichester, Phillimore 2008 - both in the Central Library.
