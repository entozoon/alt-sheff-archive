		<td>As the world marks Holocaust Memorial Day (in the UK since 2001) we share the memory of the millions who have been murdered in the Holocaust and subsequent genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur in order to challenge hatred and persecution in the world today. The 2020 Theme is "Stand Together", as The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust want us to reflect on how genocidal regimes throughout history have deliberately fractured societies by marginalising certain groups, and how these tactics can be challenged by individuals standing together with their neighbours, and speaking out against oppression. 
<i>
"In the years leading up to the Holocaust, Nazi policies and propaganda deliberately encouraged divisions within German society, urging "Aryan" Germans to keep themselves separate from their Jewish neighbours..."
</i>
A collection of posters and artwork is being displayed in the Winter Garden, including exhibitions from local schools. Short films will be screened in the Winter Garden on Holocaust Memorial Day [Monday 27 January], from 12pm to 4.30pm, and a candlelit vigil runs from 5.45pm to 7pm in the Winter Garden.
