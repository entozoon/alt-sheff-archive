		<td>The volunteers are again organising Sheffield’s fantastic annual free festival, where profits go to good causes. Don‘t be shy if you want to get involved or have any ideas, come along to one of the open meetings, everybody welcome. (They also have ‘closed meetings’ for those already involved in planning, to reduce time spent on ‘introductions’ and increase time spent on getting things done).
