		<td>To celebrate the Patron Saint of Cycling's Day, led by experienced cycle trainers from Cycle Sheffield, Pedal Ready Cycle Training Co-op and the CTC. This will be tram-assisted from the Cathedral tram stop to Waterthorpe, leaving at 10am sharp (back at the cathedral 3.30pm-ish).

£5 return per cyclist and bike, kids £2. Bring a picnic and drink and join whichever ride suits you best.

-  'Family Ride' to Treeton Pond

-  Women-only ride, gently paced, mostly off-road, route to be decided
 
-  'Moderate' ride to Langold (40 miles)

You can also, of course set off by yourself or in other groups.

The weather is sure to be as golden as today! so just come along, fill the trams and enjoy the last of British Summer Time.  <a href="mailto:polytone@doctors.org.uk">Email Polly & Tony</a></td>
