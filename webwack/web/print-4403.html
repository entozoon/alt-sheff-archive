		<td>Climate Alliance is a national alliance of organisations and individuals pressing for effective action for the UK to become a zero-carbon economy by 2030. It is not affiliated to any political party, and includes trade unions, faith groups, national environmental bodies, local campaigns and direct action networks. This broad based approach, covering a range of diverse groups each working in their own way, and also combining forces, should be a massive force for political pressure on climate change.

In Sheffield, discussion to start the Sheffield Climate Alliance is just beginning, and up to 30 local groups have so far committed to it. Please get in touch if you or someone else in your organisation has an particular interest.
