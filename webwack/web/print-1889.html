		<td>What are co-operatives and what do they mean for the way we work? Dr. Rory Ridley-Duff critiques UK perceptions of the co-operative movement using international studies in a presentation and interactive debate. Rory is a founder of the Fairshares Association and course leader for the Co-operative and Social Enterprise Management MSc at Sheffield Hallam.

The Festival of Debate is taking place in Sheffield in the run-up to the General election, during March and April. It provides opportunities to get together and discuss a range of issues which affect everyone. Informed decision making and strategic planning are essential for democracy, so come and get involved. They also welcome volunteers, from attending events and taking part in discussions to volunteering time to help run an event, promote the festival and much more. Unless otherwise stated events are free to attend, but if possible please register via the appropriate Eventbrite link on the Festival of Debate website below to give organsisers an idea of numbers.
