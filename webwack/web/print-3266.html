		<td>Food Matters supports individuals, communities and organisations to create more sustainable and fair food systems. The work includes research, project delivery, training, campaigning and consultancy projects. Training in evaluating community projects is a new half-day workshop in how to adopt a participatory approach to the evaluation of community projects. The workshop focuses on group facilitation skills to help you hear, understand and document different perspectives on project impacts. This is often a requirement of funders, but is also a great way to engage the beneficiaries of a project in assessing how well it went (or is going) and what can be done to improve it. The workshop focuses on a few simple, effective tools which are engaging, active and accessible (and often fun) to help you improve your project.
