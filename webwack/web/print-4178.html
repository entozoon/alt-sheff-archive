		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The Health and Social Care Bill, containing measures which place the NHS severely at risk from competition and privatisation, returns to the House of Commons on 6th and 7th September before going to the Lords.  The Bill has been amended, increasing the cost and bureaucracy of the reforms, but the basic dangers to the NHS remain pretty much untouched.

It is still possible to defeat this Bill if Liberal Democrats and the Opposition parties unite against it.  Make your voice heard in support of the NHS and against creeping privatisation.

Join the Sheffield Save Our NHS march on Saturday 3rd September from the Hallamshire Hospital to the City Centre

Come also to the teatime Vigil on Tuesday 6th September outside Sheffield Town Hall.
