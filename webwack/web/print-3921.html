		<td>Sheffield Cathedral requested a possession order to remove the Occupy Sheffield camp from it´s forecourt, but the judge decided that the wider implications of the protest meant that a full 2 day hearing should take place, scheduled to start on 21st February (Shrove Tuesday in the Christian calendar.)

Prior to the court case, Occupy Sheffield offered to move the camp no later than 7 days before the Cathedral required the land for building works. This offer was declined by the Cathedral. Occupy Sheffield did not choose its location in order to enter into conflict with the staff and management of the Cathedral. The worldwide people´s movement stands for social and economic justice, and it´s a distraction to be involved in a prolonged dispute of this nature. The invitation to the Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral to join the occupiers in the marquee for face-to-face discussions remains open. Watch this space ....
