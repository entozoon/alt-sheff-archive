		<td>Expert Round Table on the historic changes in US-Cuba relations, with Father Geoff Bottoms (Cuban Five Campaign), Steve Ludlam (University of Sheffield) and Karen Lawson, all of whom have a variety of interests and experience in Cuba. Karen has returned from a visit recently.

The announcements made on December 17th by Presidents Raúl Castro and Barack Obama on US-Cuba relations marked a great victory for the Cuban people who have resisted half a century of military, economic and diplomatic warfare. Cuba will be removed from the absurd US ‘terror state’ list, ending $billion fines on banks facilitating Cuba’s trade. More restrictions have been lifted from US citizens travelling to Cuba in organised groups, from remittances to Cuba, and from significant but limited areas of trade. Diplomatic relations are being restored. But the main embargo legislation will stay in place until Obama is prepared to confront Congress. And the US is tailoring its changes to support its political intervention inside Cuba to bring about what the White House calls ‘positive change’, in other words the overthrow of the socialist Constitution that 98% of Cubans voted for, on a 98% turnout.

Join the panel for a discussion about Cuba and what the change in American policy means for the island.
