		<td>Following changes to the ward boundaries in Sheffield, we will have an ‘all out’ election in May where all councillors will be up for re-election. This is the time to consider the impact of ‘all out’ and whether this is a change that should become permanent. A panel debate with presentations from Sheffield’s Electoral Services and contributions from political, academic and campaign group panellists.
