		<td>Find out more about Extinction Rebellion: who they are, why they exist, what they do, what they are trying to achieve, and how to join in. 

The planet is in ecological crisis, in the midst of the sixth mass extinction event. Scientists believe we may have entered a period of abrupt climate breakdown. This is an unprecedented global emergency. Extinction Rebellion Sheffield will share the latest climate science on where our planet is heading, discuss some of the current psychology around climate change, and offer solutions through the study of social movements.

Everyone is welcome and there will be plenty of time to ask questions and discuss afterwards.  Entry is free but please donate towards venue hire costs if you can. Please aim to arrive at Union Street 15 minutes before (at 6.45pm) for a prompt start at 7pm. If possible, please book an Eventbrite ticket (free) so that they have an idea of how many are coming.
