		<td>You can’t help but notice there has been dramatic change within the co-operative movement over the past year. What is the future of co-operation? With big opportunities and challenges ahead, co-operators must now come together to have real, open and honest conversations about the future. Anyone with a passion for co-operatives and the future of the co-operative movement is welcome to this discussion event.  

The afternoon starts with a networking lunch, then at 2pm Cath Beatty on Aizlewood Mill - a co-operative success story. Steve Thompson will speak about the Co-operative Resource Centre, which puts into practice Co-operative Principle 5 (education). Cheryl Barrott will examine Principle 6 (co-operation between co-operatives). 

The event is free, so it would be really helpful if you can let them know by 9th July if you are attending, by email to <a href="mailto:coop@aizlewoodsmill.com">coop@aizlewoodsmill.com</a> or tel Sheff 2823123
