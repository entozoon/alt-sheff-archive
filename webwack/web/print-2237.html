		<td>“Only an ignorant fool would think that competition is a good thing in health and social care” says Dr John Carlisle, Sheffield’s first altruistic organ donor, who gave a kidney to a stranger. 

On Monday 25th, Sheffield will welcome the national People’s March for the NHS, a mass protest against cuts and changes putting the NHS under threat. Its 300 mile route follows in the footsteps of the historic Jarrow Crusade. The marchers will arrive having walked this stage via Barnsley Hospital. They will go through Worsborough Mill, Tankersley, Grenoside and Hillsborough around 3.00pm approximately, where Sheffield supporters will join the march at Hillsborough Park. (Assemble at the Parkside Road entrance, by the carpark). Then on to Weston Park for a rally with speeches at 4.30pm. On Tuesday 26th the march will set off from Sheffield Town Hall at 10.00am towards Chesterfield via the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, then going through Nether Edge, Woodseats and Dronfield.

Organised by the Darlington Mums’ group, 999 Call for the NHS. Sheffield Save Our NHS is co-ordinating the event locally. Mike Simpkin of Sheffield Save Our NHS, says “We hope up to 1,000 people will join us ... the NHS is in danger from cuts and being broken up through tendering it out to individual firms. It could be gone before we know it." Come and show support in opposition to the threat of charges, and the disaster of privatisation and competition in health care.
