		<td>Campaign against the latest war which politicians have led us into. The decision by MPs to bomb Syria will not make the world a safer place. It will not stop terrorism. It is the 4th major military intervention by British governments in 14 years. The previous wars have not ended (Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya). Instead we have seen death and injury, instability across these countries, and millions of people made refugees by war, and the growth of terrorism. ISIS itself grew out of the war and occupation in Iraq.

There is an alternative - to get rid of ISIS, which is causing so much misery to the people of the Middle East and elsewhere, we need to demand our government puts pressure on allies such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia which are giving support to them. We need to campaign for peace across the Middle East, and for an end to outside intervention there.

Our politicans have learnt none of the lessons of previous wars. Instead, they repeat the same mistakes whilst the casualties of these wars are increasing numbers of civilians. With massive public opinion growing against the bombings, Stop the War have called a national demonstration this Saturday, 12th December, to demand that this government and what they are doing is not in our name and must be stopped.

Transport from Sheffield by Sheffield Stop the War Coalition, coach ticket prices are £10 unwaged/£15 low waged/£20 employed.
