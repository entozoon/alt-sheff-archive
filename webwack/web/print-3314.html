 Holocaust Memorial Day is about learning from all genocides (including the Holocaust) and, vitally, the implications for challenging all forms of hatred, persecution and prejudice in society today. It&#39;s an opportunity for people to come together who oppose racism, homophobia, sexism and all forms of discrimination to remember, celebrate diversity, protest and build bridges between commmunities.
