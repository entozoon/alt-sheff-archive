Quakers have been modern pioneers, campaigning to abolish slavery, reform prisons, and work for peace and equality. They recently made headlines again by agreeing to hold weddings for same-sex couples in their Meeting Houses. Quakers have no creeds or dogmas; instead, they try to let their lives speak. They believe that God, the Spirit, or the Light is to be found in everyone, and can be experienced directly by everyone. Drop in for an informal visit to find out more about this fascinating and powerful tradition of worship.</td>
