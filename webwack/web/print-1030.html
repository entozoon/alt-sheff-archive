		<td>A one-day workshop by Second Degree Potentias, bringing together artists, campaigners, community organisers, students and academics to investigate how artists can make work that is politically, socially and artistically effective.

Presentations: 
Nina Edge, Mel Evans (Liberate Tate) 
Kerry Morrison (In Situ)
James Marriott (Platform)

This will be a participatory event facilitated by Seeds for Change, a workers&#39; co-operative providing training and resources to help people organise for action and positive social change.

This event is for those who want to change the world with their art, and those who want to find out how art can help them change the world. It aims to bring people together and help them find kindred spirits; to suggest creative tools for community organisers and campaigners; to look at the differences between making political art and making art politically, or between being an art activist and an activist artist; to share ideas and information about making work that has an effect beyond the confines of the gallery; to look at what artists and art strategies can offer to campaigns; to think about art in the service of life.

Tickets £6, £3 concessions, students free.
