		<td>The Wild Star Food Co. has been delivering organic, fair trade and wholefoods for ages. It's a hard working South Yorkshire company, they really try to use local suppliers where reasonable, and their service is totally friendly and flexible. The new website's worth a look, especially if you live far from a decent shop.
