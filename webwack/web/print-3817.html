		<td>Welcome to Palestine 2012 is a call to challenge Israel&#39;s policy of isolation and imprisonment of the Palestinian population. Palestinians cannot easily travel but they have the right to receive visitors! Sheffield PSC members will be at Manchester airport to send good wishes and solidarity greetings with people from the UK who will be travelling to occupied Palestine. There is no way into Palestine other than through Israeli control points. Israel has turned Palestine into a giant prison, but prisoners have a right to receive visitors.

Welcome to Palestine 2012 will again challenge Israel&#39;s policy of isolating the West Bank while the settler paramilitaries and army commit brutal crimes against a virtually defenceless Palestinian civilian population. The participants in Welcome to Palestine 2012 ask to be allowed to pass through Tel Aviv airport without hindrance and to proceed to the West Bank to take part in a project there for children to benefit from the right to education.
