		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Part of a series of events exploring the multiple ways which we engage with the city, focussing on ways of living together. Whether in form of co-housing, within a single unit or high-density solutions comprised of individual units, living together is made possible by social contracts. Often unarticulated and organically evolved these protocols are vital for the viability of communality. 

Along with presentations from speakers Cristina Cerulli, Sarah Staton and Jeremy Till, and opportunities for discussion, the Shirle Hill Cohousing Group (formerly Shirle Hill Hospital, Nether Edge) will introduce their project. 

The venue is a short walk from bus service 4 (Psalter Lane), 22 (Nether Edge) or 80s services (Ecclesall Road). Please book your free place and see full details at <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/co-housinglivingbuilding-tickets-11678704319">Eventbrite </a></td>
