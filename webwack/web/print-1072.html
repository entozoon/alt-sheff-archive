		<td>At Teresa May&#39;s first Tory Party Conference as Prime Minister, the People&#39;s Assembly will be holding a mass demonstration to say we demand an alternative to "Austerity Britain" and demand investment in public services, infrastructure, and decent jobs for all. An end to scapegoating of migrants which divides our communities and whips up racism. Join in and help make sure the demonstration is as big as possible.
