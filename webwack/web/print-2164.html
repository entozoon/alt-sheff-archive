This month award-winning author and internationally recognised activist Cory Doctorow presents a talk: ‘Information Doesn’t Want to be Free.’ The internet‘s broken and that‘s bad news, because everything we do today involves the internet and everything we‘ll do tomorrow will require it. But governments and corporations see the net, variously, as a perfect surveillance tool, a perfect pornography distribution tool, or a perfect video on demand tool - not as the nervous system of the 21st century. Time‘s running out. Architecture is politics. The changes we‘re making to the net today will prefigure the future our children and their children will thrive in - or suffer under.

You do not have to be a member to come to the meet-ups.
