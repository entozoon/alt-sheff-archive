		<td>On this day, fifteen people face sentencing at Chelmsford Crown Court for trying to stop a deportation charter flight from Stansted airport to Nigeria. The government have threatened life imprisonment under anti-terrorism laws for people who take action against deportations. This is nothing less than terrorising of activists who acted in good conscience, and potentially <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/10/stansted-15-protesters-deportation">saved the lives</a> of some of the people due to be deported on that plane. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/dec/11/the-stansted-15-activists-should-be-supported-not-punished">Many people and organisations share that view</a> including Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott.
