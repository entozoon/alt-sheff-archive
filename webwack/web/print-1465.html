		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Films and talk to celebrate LGBT History Month. Priscilla took three drag queens in an infamous lavender bus across Australia, turning writer/director Stephan Elliottâ€™s wild, glittering, flamboyant and fabulously queer road movie into a watershed moment for the LGBT movement. Costumes, cabaret, lip syncing, fights, bigotry and solidarity. The film also highlights the potential of drag to bring together oppressed minorities and imagine new communities that challenge social norms. Clever, funny and beautiful.

The night also features a fascinating talk by Dr. Ben Robbins - a Postdoctoral Fellow at the John F. Kennedy Institute for North American Studies in Berlin. His talk focuses on queer literature, culture, activism and debate from the late nineteenth century to Priscilla, from the early 1990s at the peak of AIDS crisis to the present day.

Start Your Engines! afterwards in the bar, an evening extravaganza of glitter, glamour, disco, sequins and shade. Have you got enough charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent to take to the runway and lip-sync for your life!?
