		<td>In the debate about the UK energy market, the Government is suggesting a mix of nuclear power, gas, less coal, renewables, energy efficiency and a small amount of microgeneration. But nuclear new build is not necessary. Many English councils, along with countries like Germany, Switzerland, Denmark and Austria are pushing forward with future non-nuclear energy policies. An alternative energy revolution is possible, with renewable energy projects, combined heat and power (CHP) schemes, demand management energy efficiency projects and support for community microgeneration projects. What potential do these have, and how important is council leadership in developing this revolution? Can they assist in reducing fuel poverty?

This FREE seminar will consider these questions and showcase some local authority best practice examples.

Four excellent speakers including Colin Hines of the Green New Deal group, who is helping Councils develop financial deals with the banks to offer grants for energy efficiency and microgeneration projects - with impressive results particularly in Birmingham; Councillor Andrew Cooper of Kirklees Council and formerly of the Energy Saving Trust on the ways councils can reduce their own carbon footprints. Case studies from Manchester and the Dearne Valley on energy demand management and an eco-vision for South Yorkshire. 

All NFLA member councils, interested non-member councillors and officers and relevant local and national interested groups are very welcome to attend
