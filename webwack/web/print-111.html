		<td>Extinction Rebellion (XR) groups across the world are gathering in unity in key cities to rebel, because time is running out. Climate and ecological breakdown has already begun. Leading scientists and public figures, including the UN Secretary-General, have estimated we have as little as 18 months to turn it around. 

We ALL need to stand up for the Mother Earth and respect ALL life. Authority and corporations will not listen to petitions, strongly-worded pleas, or climate scientists. They have failed in their duty to protect Mother Earth. The system is broken. Young and old, we must stand together in peace. 

<strong>See also Extinction Rebellion current updates on our <a href="https://alt-sheff.org/stories">News page</a>. 

In Sheffield,  Introductory Sessions are now being run on both Saturdays (11am) and Mondays (6.45pm) during the rebellion at Union Street co-working space. Their main meetings continue on Mondays along with the introductions. They are also hoping to run a stall in Sheffield City centre and information drop-in sessions at Union Street on Saturdays, so if you could help with one of these, please email <a href="mailto:xrsheffield@gmail.com">xrsheffield@gmail.com</a>.</strong>
