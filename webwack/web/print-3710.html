		<td>Transition Sheffield has various local groups, and the <a href="http://wiki.transitionsheffield.org.uk/Aims">aims of the Hub Group</a> are to do with visioning, supporting local groups, and outreach and liaison, e.g. with the council. Anyone who would like to contribute to the activities of the group would be welcome, particularly if you feel there is no local group for you to be involved with. Agenda includes future events and activities like the next Transition Cafe event, planning a possible Food Conference, and setting up skills workshops.
