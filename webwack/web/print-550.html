		<td>Zimbabwe refugees who have lived here for years are now facing deportation, rather than extension to their right to safety here in the UK. According to NewZimbabwe.com, the British ambassador to Zimbabwe Catriona Laing, told Zimbabwean Deputy President Kembo Mohadi that our government intends to deport 2,500 "illegal Zimbabweans". 

Very few people have been deported to Zimbabwe over the past ten years, but there are now reports of Zimbabwe Embassy staff going to detention centres to interview any Zimbabwe nationals there to give them travel documents so that they can be forcibly deported. Some have already been deported to Zimbabwe, where the same regime is in power even though Mugabe has gone. Their lives are in danger.

Marian Machekanyanga of South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG), an exiled trade unionist from Zimbabwe, says: "Nothing has changed for Zimbabwean people here or at home ... there are no changes and no democracy". 

Demonstrate to tell Home Secretary Sajid Javid to stop deporting Zimbabwean refugees. This is Theresa Mayâ€™s "Hostile Environment" yet again bringing misery and danger to families seeking protection from persecution and torture in the UK.
