		<td>Sheffield Refugee Asylum Seeker Action Group (RASAG) have organised an event for refugee week and the summer of sanctuary called Legends. This storytelling workshop is looking for participants to join the group from refugee and asylum seeker communities, who will be taught how to tell stories by a professional. The stories will be chosen by themselves and can be from any cultural background. After the day workshop people will be given the opportunity to perform their stories and produce a notice board with pictures and writing in English and community languages, a scrapbook and a visitor's book.
