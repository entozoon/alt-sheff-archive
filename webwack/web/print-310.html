		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Morton Hall Immigration Removal Centre, in Lincolnshire, is a prison contracted to the Home Office as an Immigration Removal Centre (IRC) which can detain 392 people. There have been several deaths in recent years inside its walls, with nearly half the detainees feeling suicidal or depressed according to a 2017 Prison Inspectors report. 

Join South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG), Sheffield Student Action for Refugees (STAR), Sheffield Labour Students and These Walls Must Fall, to protest against the cruel and inhumane treatment of detainees at Morton Hall. 

Morton Hall is where our Zimbabwean friends from South Yorkshire, Victor, Khuzani and Benji, were detained and threatened with deportation last month. A huge campaign secured their release and halted the Home Office deportation plans. This demonstation will build on that success. In October 2018, Sheffield organisations were among many who surrounded Morton Hall to show solidarity with those inside. They continue to campaign to bring an end to the racist and oppressive institution of detention in the UK. This is a return visit with more numbers, more banners and more noise to demand that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/no-one-listened-now-four-11964977">this grim place</a> is shut down for good.
