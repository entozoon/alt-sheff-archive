		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A Socialist Workers Party public meeting with Weyman Bennett, contributor to new book <i>Say it Loud! Marxism and the Fight Against Racism</i>. Racism, from rebellions against slavery in the 18th century to the fight against police harassment and the racism of UKIP, EDL and the Tories is a radical history of black and white working class unity. This public meeting will counter the myth that racism is inevitable. It is an oppressive part of capitalism, and it will put the case for revolutionary struggle to end both.
