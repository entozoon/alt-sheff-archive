		<td>Times are a&#39;changing, faith in the institutions once depended upon has been rocked to its very core and as our eyes are opened to the realities of the world before us, we are once again taking back the responsibility of judging right and wrong for ourselves. For years we accepted the way things are, happily bowing down to the powers that be and those in the know, only to be shown time-and-time-again that unregulated positions of control and power cannot be trusted to act with anything other than their own self-interests at heart. As our global consciousness gradually awakens, people from every walk of life take an ethical lens to every facet of the societies in which we live, the cracks are clear for all to see.

Pecha Kucha Vol #12 is an exploration into the truth behind the issues that influence so much of the lives we live today and the ones we will have to make choices about tomorrow. 

Pecha Kucha, meaning ‘chit chat’ in Japanese, is a global, viral phenomenon now running in 502 countries across the planet. The 20x20 format was first started in Japan 2003 by the architects Astrid Klein and Mark Dytham...brought to you in Sheffield by Jonny Douglas and Pennie Raven. Each presenter is given 20 slides and just 20 seconds per slide to present their subject or showcase their work. Creating a truly different event experience; guaranteeing an entertaining, educational and inspiring atmosphere for all.

Minimum age: 18. Entry £5/£8. Last entry: 8pm
