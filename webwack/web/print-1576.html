		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. This month: a special collaboration with Sheffield’s famous sauce "Henderson’s Relish". Ride starts 6.30pm, followed by a night out from 7.30-11.30pm, both at The Hide, Scotland Street. 

The cycle ride will visit places where Henderson’s is and has been made. Small bottle of Hendo’s will be given to each rider. (NB The ride is free; riders do not have to join the Henderson’s Friday Night Out!) 

The Henderson’s Friday Night Out! is open to all. Soul and Sheffield music with (hopefully) Shaun from Everly Pregnant Brothers as curator/DJ. Also a Henderson’s stall selling Relish and Henderson’s merchandise, exhibition of artwork inspired by Hendersons (open for a week at The Hide) and a CycleSheffield Stall promoting cycling in Sheffield, memberships, and merchandise. Tickets £15 per person if purchased from Percy & Lily’s, Sheffield FridayNightRide or Amici and Bici. £16.55 from Eventbrite. Tickets include food, drink and entry to the event including a non-alcoholic Henderson’s Bloody Mary cocktail (optional vodka £2.50). Food includes vegetarian option. Licensed bar until 11pm; coffee and tea bar.
