		<td>Sheffield Transformative Justice Learning Group offers an open space to collectively learn about responding to harms in our communities. Patterns of intimate partner violence and abuse are not always best dealt with by the state (eg Police). Transformative justice and community accountability approaches value the everyday skills and power that we have to end violence. The work of this group is in collectively learning how to translate this work and its lessons into our everyday contexts, challenges and peculiarities of our city.
