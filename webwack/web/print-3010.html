		<td>Transition Sheffield host an afternoon workshop and evening event with Rob Hopkins, an engaging speaker, a co-founder of the Transition Movement, and a winner of various awards and plaudits as a leading grassroots campaigner, "green community hero", and "new radical".

The afternoon workshop will explore aspects of sustainability which are increasingly important, bringing together a wide range of people to ask both naïve and informed questions about the future sustainability and resilience of Sheffield. The workshop will include small group discussions and some simple activities to enable everyone to demonstrate their opinions. Depending on the interests of those present, this will explore a range of relevant themes and key questions such as:

<b>Energy:</b> What could a future energy balance for Sheffield look like?  
How can we think differently about energy harvesting and use?
<b>Money:</b> The local economic balance - how does financial growth relate to local poverty?  
Positive money - how do we make money work for the future?
<b>Food:</b> Do we have a realistic food footprint for Sheffield?   
Should we intervene to balance expensive organic food, food banks, urban food-growing, and supermarket price wars?
<b>Resources:</b> Should we challenge the consumer culture?  
Can we change the belief that repairing goods is a sign of failure?
<b>People:</b> How do politics and communities in Sheffield currently address sustainability?
Are other models of business and political engagement worth exploring?

The workshop is therefore an opportunity to create and share ideas about opportunities and priorities for Sheffield in becoming more genuinely sustainable at multiple levels, and the outcomes may contribute to future activities within Sheffield and beyond. At the evening event, Rob Hopkins will use examples from <a href="http://transitionculture.org/shop/the-power-of-just-doing-stuff/">"The Power of Just Doing Stuff"</a>, the latest Transition Book, to describe the innovative and positive ways that Transition Initiatives are already harnessing grassroots community action to create a new and more sustainable reality. 

<b>Afternoon event</b> 1.30-4pm, Sheffield Cathedral, Domino Hall, S1 1HA, Free Entry (donations welcome) 

<b>An Evening with Rob Hopkins</b> 7-9pm Quaker Meeting House, Sheffield S1 2EW, £5/£3
