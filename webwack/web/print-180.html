		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The return of the city&#39;s annual community festival and parade celebrating lesbian, gay, bisexual, non-binary and trans life, and welcoming friends, family and everyone to join in the fun. Everything starts with a parade from Pear Street at 12.00 noon.

2019 is also the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, a pivotal moment for LGBT+ communities and a worldwide catalyst for change. 

Pride is organised by a committee of elected volunteers, and is funded through sponsorship and donations. Endcliffe Park is 2 miles south-west of Sheffield city centre, at Rustlings Road junction with Ecclesall Road. Buses from city centre are very frequent.
