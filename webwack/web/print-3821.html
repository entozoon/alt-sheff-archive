		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The Sunday Times’ recent investigation into the Conservative Party’s fundraising operation has focussed the public’s attention on the influence that can be bought within our political system. We may have been shocked by the frank language used by former Conservative party treasurer Peter Cruddas but the news that money talks within our political system came as no surprise.

Meanwhile the government’s consultation process on its proposals for a register of lobbyists is currently underway.  "Sheffield for Democracy" is organising this public meeting to discuss the proposals, just before the consultation process closes.

Speakers: Paul Blomfield MP for Sheffield Central (Labour) and Joe Otten Councillor for Dore and Totley, also Chair of Hallam LibDems. Tamasin Cave of the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency will also be speaking, to give a national perspective.
