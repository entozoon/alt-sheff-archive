		<td>Sheffield City Council has announced that it is establishing a Green Commission for the city, following the Fairness Commission, which looked at how Sheffield can be a fairer more equitable place to live and work. 

Cllr. Jack Scott will introduce the city council agenda on green issues. Followed by interactive discussion around proposed topics including climate change adaptation and mitigation, sustainable transport, green business and sustainable growth, green infrastructure, quality of life/placemaking, low carbon energy and resource efficiency.

One purpose of the session is to seek views to ensure that the topics are the right ones, and understand the top priorities within each area so that these can be examined in further detail in in commission hearings.

Due to space constraints, numbers are limited to around 100 so it is vital that you notify in advance of your attendance and any special requirements you have, so if you wish to go, please email <a href="mailto:greencommission@sheffield.gov.uk">greencommission@sheffield.gov.uk</a></td>
