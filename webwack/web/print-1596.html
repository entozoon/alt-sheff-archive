		<td>Nobel Prize holder Richard Roberts (New England Biolabs) believes that genetic modification of food (GMO) has potential health benefits. He is speaking in Sheffield as part of "Krebsfest" (honouring the scientist Hans Krebs). The university publicity says of GMO foods, without qualification, that "the developing world needs them desperately". Hopefully the audience questions will be a little more challenging.
