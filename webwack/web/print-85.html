Simba Mujakachi and many other Zimbabweans in Sheffield were threatened with deportation earlier this year and only a huge campaign succeeded in defending them, securing releases from Morton Hall Detention Centre and halting the Home Office’s deportation plans. The Home Office deliberately put pressure on the Zimbabwean community, with the prospect of deportation to Zimbabwe where there is still persecution of people protesting against the military dictatorship. <strong>There were even interrogations by a Zimbabwean Embassy official at Vulcan House in Sheffield, invited by the Home Office.</strong>
 
During this stressful time Simba, a 30-year old fitness instructor, had a life-threatening, partially paralysing stroke.</strong> With no income, he was charged over £100,000 by the NHS for the care he needed to save his life.</strong> Simba’s case is not an isolated one – it’s a result of the hostile environment policy which denies people in our community the services and resources they need to live.   
 
Hear from Simba and his father Victor, joined by SYMAAG, Migrants Organise, Docs Not Cops and Medact.</td>
