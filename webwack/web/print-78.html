		<td>"Gaza", directed by Garry Keane and Andrew McConnell, 2019, lasts 92 mins. With an introduction by Shahd Abusalama of Sheffield Hallam University, this rich documentary portrait of Gaza challenges the media image of this tiny strip of land. ‘This unique and vibrant land, rich in culture and history, is home to a people who are oppressed and dehumanised but who are also resilient and strong and who want nothing more than to live normal lives. How do you tell the story of such a place?’ asks director Garry Keane. 

"The Reports on Sarah and Saleem" is directed by Muayad Alayan, 2018. The screening starts 3.30pm, lasts 127 mins, followed by a Skype Q&A with the director. It is about the extra-marital affair between a Palestinian man and an Israeli woman has political consequences under Israeli rule. Caught up in the occupation machinery and socio-political pressure, Sarah and Saleem find themselves trapped in a web of deceit which not even the truth looks able to stop.
