		<td>SYMAAG unites refugee, asylum and migrant organisations with campaign groups and supporting individuals for the rights of those seeking asylum and of those coming to work in this country. 

This month the main discussion will be about the privatisation of asylum housing in Yorkshire and Humberside. Although G4S (the company that usually locks up asylum seekers rather than house them) eventually won the contract, SYMAAG believes that asylum seeker tenants, with support, can monitor housing standards and challenge any cost-cutting reductions or abuse by G4S. SYMAAGâ€™s John Grayson has written in-depth on this subject. For information on G4S and asylum housing see <a href="http://notog4s.blogspot.co.uk/">http://notog4s.blogspot.co.uk</a>.

Also discussion of a joint submission to the <a href="http://alt-sheff.org/stories/254">Sheffield Fairness Commission</a> about the treatment of asylum seekers in the UK and planning the Annual General Meeting on May 1st with guest speaker Catherine Ramos from the Justice First organisation, who will talk about their report on the treatment of deported Congolese asylum seekers.
