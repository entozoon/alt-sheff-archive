		<td>"From Servants to Staff" research project is a collaboration between the University of Sheffield and the nearby Chatsworth Estate, a huge house and grounds still owned by a minor branch of the ’nobility’ (not by the people). Hear stories of dairy maids, gardeners, upholsterers and governesses through the eyes of the people who worked for the ’landed gentry’, who are probably very nice people, not parasites.
