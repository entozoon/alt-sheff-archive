		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Asylum seekers in South Yorkshire are facing threats such as forcible deportation to face certain danger in Zimbabawe, Afghanistan and Iraq, being forced into destitution because they are not allowed to work and have benefits withdrawn; benefits being cut by £7 to £35 a week; and being forced to travel the length of the country to make a claim for asylum.

Coming up to Christmas, a demonstration to show that the people of South Yorkshire stand in solidarity with those seeking asylum from war, persecution and torture.

Demo organised by <a href="http://www.nrcentre.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=87:symaag&amp;Itemid=107&amp;layout=default">SYMAAG</a>, which campaigns both for the rights of those seeking asylum and of those coming to work in this country, and supported by <a href="http://www.cdas-sheffield.org.uk/">Sheffield Committee to Defend Asylum Seekers</a> and many refugee community groups.</td>
