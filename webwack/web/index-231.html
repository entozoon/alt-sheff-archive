	<p class="message">There are many forces in the world that seek to divide us. To close the <a href="http://www.festivalofdebate.com/">Festival of Debate 2019</a>, this Living Together Hub Day seeks to explore new ways that we can live and work together.  It explores a range of issues facilitated by a series of short sessions by groups. <strong>All day stalls</strong>, from Fairness on the 83, Perspectives on UBI, Disability Sheffield, ASSIST<strong>1-2pm, Disability Sheffield Independence Cafe</strong>Participants will choose and discuss three items from the café menu: Independent Living, Social Inclusion, Choice & Control, then write to elected representatives with key findings from the discussions in relation to social care and how it fits with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Disabled People.<strong>1-2pm, How can we build the kind of democracy that empowers us to make connections?</strong>OpenDemocracy editor and journalist Adam Ramsay will run a session based on his pamphlet, Trying to milk a vulture: If we want economic justice, we need a democratic revolution, about how to build the kind of democracy that empowers us to make connections and nurture egalitarian and flourishing communities.<strong>2:15-3pm, Co-operation and Collective Decision Making</strong>The Principle 5 Co-operative Resource Centre believes that cooperation is what the world needs. Representatives from the growing range of cooperatives in this region invite you to discuss how and why they do it - and what exactly it&#39;s like to be running a co-op.<strong>2:15-3pm, Sentenced to Death: Campaigning against the death penalty</strong>Amnesty International firmly believe that no one - including any government - has the right to take away someone else&#39;s life. It is launching a specific network to focus on abolishing the death penalty. Amnesty International will give a talk on the death penalty around the world, with opportunities to take action and support the campaign.<strong>3:15-4:30pm, Responding to hate crime in public spaces</strong>Hate crime in public spaces happens. How do we react? What do we say? Did we get it right? Join Who is Your Neighbour for an interactive workshop and leave with some shared experiences of different responses to hate crime.<strong>3:15-4:30pm, Somaliland: Past, present and future</strong>Join Green Party Cllr. Kaltum Rivers and a representative of the Somaliland Mission in the UK to hear how self-declared independent state Somaliland is functioning effectively as a state and how its future might look. Chaired by Natalie Bennett from Sheffield Green Party.<strong>3:15-4:30pm, Starting a conversation about homelessness</strong>South Yorkshire Housing Association host an interactive event, including a film screening, to encourage conversations about ending homelessness in the Sheffield area.<strong>4:45-6pm, Why are there so many people sleeping rough in Sheffield?</strong>Official figures report that 26 people sleep out in Sheffield on any given night. Are these figures accurate? Who are these 26 people? What is being done to help them? Can we ever get to the point where nobody has to sleep out in our city? Can you be part of the solution? Session in association with Roundabout.Full details on all of the individual sessions on the website. Reserving a free ticket guarantees you a place throughout the day.
