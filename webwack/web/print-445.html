		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Fracking causes toxic and radioactive water contamination, air pollution, massive road traffic, earth tremors, and adds to climate change. Ineos, a company licensed for fracking, are targeting rural areas around Sheffield for drilling, among tens of thousands of wells, pipelines and compressor stations threatened across the UK, and supported politically by only the Conservative Party.

Sheffield Against Fracking meets on the first Tuesday of each month, to support and plan campaigns and actions. All welcome.
