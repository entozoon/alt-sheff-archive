		<td>A fringe event of Sheffield Green Commission. Shed talks are 3-5 minute fast paced “think pieces” about sustainability from a range of speakers, including professors from both universities and grass-roots activists. The event will be chaired by Paulette Edwards from BBC Radio Sheffield. This is the final Green Commission event held in public before the Autumn so even if you can only spare half an hour please do come and join in. 

Paulette and all the speakers have generously given their time free of charge to make this event happen and Sheffield Hallam University have kindly provided the venue free of charge. There are over 100 free tickets for this event and they want to encourage a diverse audience so please circulate further via email and social media. Late-coming guests admitted in between the talks. If you would like to offer a talk please contact and they will try to arrange the agenda to fit you in. Cyclists please bring your bicycle bells in with you to ring speakers off the stage if they over-stay their 10 minute slot.
