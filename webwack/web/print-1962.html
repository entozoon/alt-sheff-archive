		<td>Kathryn Ecclestone discusses the rise of ‘well-being’ interventions in education and whether these promote vulnerability or build resilience. Kathryn began her career in education with unemployed 16-19 year olds in the late 1970s before moving into further education to work with adults on Access to Higher Education programmes, young people on vocational courses and teacher training. Her current research and publications explore the ways in which growing concern about ‘emotional well-being’, ‘resilience’ and  ‘vulnerability’ have encouraged ideas and practices from therapy, counselling and psychology to permeate all areas of education, with profound changes on the teacher/academic/student relationship, teaching, assessment and support systems. Her latest book is Emotional well-being in policy and practice: interdisciplinary perspectives.

Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. Talks are typically about a common belief that can be demonstrated to be false or cannot be justified by the available evidence. The events are free though they ask for a £3 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
