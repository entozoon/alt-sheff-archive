		<td>The footbridge is 7 years old and to mark the occasion Residents Against Station Closure (RASC) are having a birthday celebration to which you are invited. There will be a giant birthday cake, music and street theatre and, hopefully, a guest appearance from the man himself, the director of East Midlands Trains, Tim Shoveller! Hope you can come along and join in the fun.

RASC is the pressure group campaigning to stop new barriers at Sheffield Railway Station. The footbridge links communities and organisations on both sides of the station. Ticket barriers would prevent free access to the city centre or the tram stop behind the station.
