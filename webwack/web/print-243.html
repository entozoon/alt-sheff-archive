		<td>School Strike Plus everyone else is invited to join in the biggest UK and global event yet! General strike!

100,000 species go extinct annually due to pollution. Resources are dwindling. We have only 8-12 years left to take drastic and immediate action. Extinction Rebellion urges everyone to respect nature, go vegan for animals and this planet, and join in these protests if you can. This is not going away; this is serious.
<strong>
Sheffield Youth Strike 4 Climate: All supporters are welcome. Assemble at Devonshire Green at 11am, march to the town hall, then a rally until 2pm. Please bring your friends and family, and bring your own signs and banners.
