		<td>This day-long event is not just a talking shop on the importance of access to justice for women. They plan real action, which includes volunteering needed from the general public and students, who will hopefully commit to a number of hours to the charities that work in this field. The goodwill of volunteers is vital to their success in improving people&#39;s lives.

A free event organised by academics and students from Sheffield Hallam University Department of Law and Criminology, as part of the SHU annual Social Justice Week. Limited spaces available; includes lunch and refreshments. Arrive from 8.30am.
