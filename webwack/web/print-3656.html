		<td>We have over 2.5 million unemployed, and we have empty factories, offices and shops – everything we need in fact to produce the goods and services society needs. Yet the economy seems to be unable to produce enough real wealth for lack of money.

Where does money come from? Who creates it? And what are the implications for our failing economy?

This talk looks at how our debt-based money system is the root cause of many of our economic problems, and explains the Positive Money proposals to reform and democratise our money supply. The talk is given by Peter Verity, a supporter of the Positive Money campaign in Sheffield. Followed by a discussion, finishing at 9pm. Meet from 7.15pm (coffee/tea and biscuits available) for a 7.30 start. Voluntary donation of £3 requested to cover costs.
