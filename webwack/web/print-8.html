		<td><strong>SORRY THIS EVENT IS POSTPONED</strong>

Over the last few years, the media’s increasingly hostile rhetoric towards migrants and refugees has led to the demonisation and ’othering’ of people born outside the UK. Could a UBI (Universal Basic Income) form part of the solution, giving refugees a real stake in the UK as well as an economic platform from which to build a new life?

Join UBI Lab Sheffield’s Tchiyiwe T Chihana (Migration Matters Festival, African Voices Platform) for an informal talk followed by a discussion. (Followed by ongoing project updates and planning from 7.30pm)

All welcome, free.
