		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Charlie Kiss discusses his recently released memoir, ‘A New Man’. It is a story of broken families, isolation and a total collapse of identity. Anti-nuclear protest at Greenham Common results in imprisonment. Severe mania and crisis of identity results in hospitalisation, homelessness, loss of friends and dignity.

Throughout all these challenges lies the conflict of self-identity within, as Charlie knows deep down that he is male, but this is repressed. As a lesbian feminist Charlie believes that he should fight against stereotypes of what it is to be a woman but the repressed feelings keep resurfacing until finally Charlie transitions and is far happier and calmer but there are surprises at how the world treats him differently.
