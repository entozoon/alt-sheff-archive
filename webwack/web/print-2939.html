		<td>Open Rights Group Sheffield is for anyone interested in digital rights, copyright, freedom of expression, censorship .. all the politics of the internet. You do not have to be a member to come to meet-ups. 

This month Claire Gowler will talk about the role of the perceptions of internet pornography in shaping current law; including bans on "violent" pornography, adult content filters, and the application of anti-piracy measures. She will examine the validity of these laws, the difficulty in defining and enforcing them and asking exactly what are they trying to prevent.

Plus discussion and a regular round-up of the latest digital-rights news, opinions, and happenings.

You do not have to sign up here to come along - but if you do it helps to avoid exceeding the venue capacity. Pseudonymous sign-ups are fine!
