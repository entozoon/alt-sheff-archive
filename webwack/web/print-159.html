		<td>An affinity group is a small group of people who come together to prepare for and take direct action. Joining or forming an affinity group is one of the best ways to get involved in Extinction Rebellion (XR).

From October 7th Extinction Rebellion will be returning to the streets of London to protest against the governmentâ€™s criminal inaction in preventing climate and ecological disaster. XR Sheffield is providing these affinity group workshops to help people who are going to London on the same dates to meet each other in advance and form affinity groups.
