		<td>The aim of this meeting is bring together members of our communities from all corners of the city, to build a united campaign to fight the bedroom tax. The campaign against the bedroom tax is beginning to take off with communities across the city holding meetings and beginning to get organised collectively. Discussions should include:

Forming a group made up of members from each community effected that can co-ordinate city wide activity against the bedroom tax bringing together the growing number of estate groups to act collectively.

Planning support for communities across the city that want to get organised to hold meetings to fight the tax.

Planning of a regional South Yorkshire/North Derbyshire demo in Sheffield.

Advice on individual and collective action which can be taken.

Raising of support from trade unions and other groups across the city.
