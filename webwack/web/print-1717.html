		<td>Truth and Lies in Advertising is a Skeptics in the Pub get-together, a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to a talk. Richard Burdett, who began his career at Saatchi & Saatchi, looks at advertising from both the consumer’s and the advertiser’s perspective. Can consumers trust what they’re seeing, reading, hearing and clicking on? And, in an increasingly fragmented and fractured media environment, can advertisers trust the data on which they’re making multi-million pound investment decisions?

Free event though they ask for a £3 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
