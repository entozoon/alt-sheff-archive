		<td>Hundreds of cyclists are staging The Big Ride, a 435 mile sponsored bike ride from Edinburgh to London in August 2015 – to raise awareness and money for Palestinian children in the Gaza strip. Last year, in defiance of international law by inflicting collective punishment, the Israeli state launched a brutal assault on Gaza. Among the 2,200 or more people killed were at least 547 children. In response to this massacre a group of keen cyclists from across the UK launched The Big Ride.

400,000 Palestinian children suffer trauma, the United Nations estimates, as a result of witnessing injury, death and destruction. In contact with charities working on the ground in Gaza the aim is to raise £50,000 for the Middle Eastern Children’s Alliance to support their work helping children to recover. They lost their homes and countless loved ones when the Israeli war machine rained missiles on them for nearly two months. 

Nearly two million people live in Gaza, an area less than the size of Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster. They have done nothing wrong.  The majority are descendants from refugees following the ethnic cleansing of what is now Israel in 1948. Imagine that you cannot go beyond the border. Even the sea on the western border is blockaded by Israel. Palestinian fishing boats are systematically shot at by the Israeli military. The Big Ride celebrates the freedom of the open road. Palestinians of Gaza are confined to this tiny patch of land. The message from Gaza was profound thanks for this offer of help, but also: “Please tell the world about what is happening to us.”  

The Big Ride therefore appeals to people to take the time to learn more about the plight of the Palestinian people, living under 21st century apartheid. Details here: <a href="http://www.redspokes.co.uk/thebigride/">www.redspokes.co.uk/thebigride</a>
