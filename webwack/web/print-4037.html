		<td>Jason from the Sheffield Equality Group will tell a story of the wealth gap, and its impact on our society. Over time and between countries, study after study has shown that the greater the wealth gap, the more problems society has - from crime, to health, to trust, to education. The only way money can make us happy, once our basic needs are met, is to share it. The story will end with an open discussion on whether promoting the value of well-being and happiness could reduce the power of money, and make a more equal country possible. 

A public meeting with Sheffield Equality Group.</td>
