		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. They've been doing this two years so this is a 2nd birthday ride. Last we heard the theme was planned to be Ruskin in Sheffield, but check their excellent website for details.
