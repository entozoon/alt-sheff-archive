		<td>This free event is chance to find out more about Sheffield Renewables' work developing community owned renewable energy in and around the city. Sheffield Renewables is working towards people-power kind of sustainable energy projects that will be built in Sheffield. River-water power looks set to be the first up and running in 2010/2011. 

One-to-One sessions are an evening of relaxed, informal activities. They enable those that have been following progress to update themselves and help others to find out more about the projects. If you attend you can choose to pass on the information to friends, family and neighbours if you wish. It would be great if everyone in Sheffield could keep track of how things progress. 

(Rutland Arms is at 86 Brown Street, S1 2BS, down from Showroom cinema past HUBS, function room upstairs)
