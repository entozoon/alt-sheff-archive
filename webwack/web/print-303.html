		<td>Cycle Sheffield is a voluntary organisation with over 1000 supporters. They campaign for a cycle friendly Sheffield where anyone can choose to make their journey by bike and for cycling to be inclusive and easy, not limited to the quick and the brave. They meet with local politicians and decision-makers and represent the voice of people in Sheffield who want their city to provide active transport options that give everyone the freedom to get around by bike. A voice for everyday cycling with the local media and on the council agenda, they also respond to plans which will affect transport and cycling, assess them and, where needed and possible, propose alternatives solutions. New members welcome.
