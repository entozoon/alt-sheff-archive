		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. Their motto is: "We have nothing to lose but our chains!" (But bring locks and lights too, just in case). 

This month the theme is Bounded "Infinity II", a 12 to 15 mile bike ride, with no repeated paths, and all inside "Greater Nether Edge"! No doubt all will be revealed on the website, and on the night.
