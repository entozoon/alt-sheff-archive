		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The Tories plan to end freedom of movement, a loss of rights for millions, and on 22 November, they will announce wide-ranging measures to make life harder for all migrants in the UK. This “hostile environment”, with scandals like Windrush, makes us poorer in every way.

Join with Another Europe is Possible, South Yorkshire Migrant and Asylum Action Group and others in this rally to refuse the anti-migrant agenda, and say: hands off freedom of movement; migrants are welcome here.
