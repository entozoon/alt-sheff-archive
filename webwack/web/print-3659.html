		<td>The Catholic Church in Ireland is in turmoil because of its long history of abuse and cover-up. Its status has been damaged beyond repair. Mike Granvilleâ€™s talk will cover the history of this tragedy and look at the precarious position of the man at the centre of the storm. 

A talk open to the public, organised by the Sheffield Humanist Society, all welcome. Please note that meetings are now at a new venue and on a different day.
