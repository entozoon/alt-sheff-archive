		<td>An interactive theatre show exploring class and social mobility by splitting its audience in two. ‘Elites’ decide the outcome of the show. ‘Standards’ get to play games. Game winners get to become Elites. So that’s fair for everyone. Right?

Part of Festival of Debate, in association with Theatre Delicatessen. Ticket prices from £7-£10
