		<td>Lots of things are happening in the local divestment from fossil fuels campaign with People and Planet taking action at both Universities and the Bishop of Sheffield taking a high profile lead in Sheffield Diocese and nationally. Sheffield Climate Alliance will focus on continuing to lobby the South Yorkshire Pension Authority (SYPA) to re-consider their investments in fossil fuels. There are 12 Councillors from South Yorkshire on the SYPA committee. After a petition of SYPA last year it appears they are not yet convinced of the need to re-consider their fossil fuel investments. The meeting will be discussing their reply and reviewing a draft flyer for the campaign. 

This is a first meeting and everyone is welcome to attend; it would be great to have people there who have a pension with SYPA (Local Government Pension Fund), from anywhere in South Yorks. If you can’t come along but are interested in being a contact for the campaign, or would like to see a copy of SYPA’s reply, please email <a href="mailto:sheffieldclimatenews@gmail.com">sheffieldclimatenews@gmail.com</a></td>
