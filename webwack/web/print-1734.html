		<th>Details</th>
		<td>An open discussion on what is becoming a crisis in social care in the city. A meeting for all using Sheffield social care services, direct payments, etc, their carers and all their allies. 

Some people have lost a third of their care with only 20 minutes allocated for bathing, breakfast AND dressing. Others are having to pay up to a third of their care themselves - something the public is generally unaware of.  People have told (not in all cases) of rude and unhelpful staff or difficult and traumatic assessments. Others have been offered ’re-ablement or nothing’. Many are frequently trapped in their homes due to cuts in services.

This will be a friendly and positive event where people who feel under pressure can come and share their experiences in a safe environment. Local MPs and councillors will be invited to attend at least part of the meeting. 

Organised by Sheffield Care Matters, a new network of people with disabilities, sicknesses or chronic illness who are dependent on carers for help with everyday activities. 

Tea and coffee provided. Cafe on site (sandwiches, salads, soups, drinks, etc.) For any further details, email <a href="mailto:sheffieldcarematters15@gmail.com">sheffieldcarematters15@gmail.com</a></td>
