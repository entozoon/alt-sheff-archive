		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A discussion on the campaign against the Database state as it enters its second phase following the election of a government that has a mandate to scrap the most visible of the schemes NO2ID has been opposing. It would be a useful meeting for people to attend in order that they can get some flavour of the task ahead and decide to what extent they would like a continued role in nailing down the Database State. 

Meetings are public and are open for anyone to attend. If you want to get involved with the campaign or just want to find out more about the issues come along. The meeting room is upstairs. If you can't find it please ask the bar staff.
