		<td>Nae Pasaran! is a Scottish-Spanish slogan to describe the true story of the Scots who managed to ground half of Chile’s Air Force, in workers’ solidarity against Pinochet’s brutal dictatorship. In 1974 a group of workers at the Rolls Royce factory in East Kilbride showed their support for the people of Chile by refusing to carry out the vital repairs of engines for Hawker Hunter planes, which had been used during the brutal military coup. Tickets £7.
