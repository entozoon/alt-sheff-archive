		<td>The organisation formerly known as World Development Movement has, from January, <a href="http://groups.wdm.org.uk/sheffield/2014/12/11/global-justice-sheffield-a-new-name-for-wdm-sheffield/">changed its name to Global Justice Now</a>. For this meeting, there is a change from the usual 1st Thursday of the month to the 3rd, and there is also a change of venue.

Global Justice Now  aims to change the actions, policies and institutions of governments, corporations and wealthy minorities, which are preventing an end to poverty and injustice. Part of a global movement, it works alongside people protesting in the developing world, on issues like Ghana being pressured to pass a new law that will restrict small-scale farmers and food producers from freely saving, exchanging and selling seeds. This will side-line traditional varieties and push farmers towards buying seeds from big business like Monsanto year after year. And small-scale farmers could even face criminalisation for saving seeds that corporations lay claim to.
