		<td>4 people have died at Morton Hall detention centre in the last year. 25% of people detained there are "at high risk" of self-harm.  Read the report in the Daily Mirror "No one listened now 4 are dead". SYMAAG (South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action  Group) have recently submitted detailed evidence to the Home Affairs Committee investigation into immigration detention regarding Morton Hall (Swinderby, Lincolnshire, the nearest to us in South Yorkshire). People detained at Morton Hall welcome protests and displays of solidarity with them. As SYMAAG left a protest in 2017 one man shouted "Thanks for coming, get it out there, tell people whats happening in here". You can read reports of previous protests via the SYMAAG website. 

Join protesters from all over the UK to demand "Shut Down Morton Hall". There is a limited number of places in cars from Sheffield and Barnsley. If you have not already reserved a place, please contact Manuchehr at <a href="mailto:manuchehrm@gmail.com">SYMAAG</a> by Wednesday 25th. See <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/831127007071294/">Facebook event page</a> for more details
