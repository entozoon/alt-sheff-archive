		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A talk by Dr Natalie Hammond, University of Sheffield, organised by Sheffield Humanist Society. Laws surrounding paying for sex have long been heavily influenced by received, frequently religious, 'morality'. Drawing on recent Doctoral research, this talk takes an alternative view of paying for sex and policy debates, focusing upon the realities for those involved. It also questions the extent to which Labour's major review of the laws surrounding paying for sex was driven by evidence based policy or a radical feminist ideology which perceives all men who pay for sex as sexual exploiters.

Open to the public, all welcome.
