		<td>Sheffield Save Our NHS (SSONHS) is fighting the appalling government plans for cuts, competition and privatization for the benefit of private companies. 

April 1st saw the implementation of the Health and Social Care Act and the introduction of regulations forcing competitive tender for NHS services wherever possible. Already private companies are carving out huge slices. Now the Government has given them carte blanche to damage any attempts which local commissioners may make to keep the NHS public by forcing all but a highly restricted number of contracts to be put out to open competitive tender. 

Now, more than ever, the NHS needs your active support to remain a public service. Local interest in campaigning for the NHS is building all the time. Get involved, show your support for the NHS.
