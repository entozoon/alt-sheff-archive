Directed exclusively by women, the films in this programme adopt different strategies towards issues surrounding the use value of documentary film.

Part of Sheffield Fringe 2016: Object Documentary. The biennial Sheffield Fringe 2016 is held at Bloc Projects, in Sheffield’s Cultural Industries Quarter, coinciding with Sheffield International Documentary Film Festival (Doc/Fest). A nine-day programme of film screenings, talks and performances. Many of the short documentaries and artists’ films have very interesting politically and socially engaged content. 

All events are free and booking is not required.
