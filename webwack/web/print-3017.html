		<td>Sometimes the hardest part of an adventure is knowing when it is over. A true story filmed over four year by one man on a bicycle. When 23 year old Tom and his friends set off from their English Village to cycle around the world, they were expecting physical hardship, extreme conditions and a serious case of culture shock. But the hours spent poring over maps could never prepare them for the experience of life on the road: petty squabbles, the extreme hospitality, the unexpected joys and dangers.

And then Tom meets Tenny, a feisty Iranian Armenian girl with dreams of her own, and hits a crossroad. Should he give up his grand plan for the girl he loves, or cycle off and risk missing out on the greatest adventure of them all?
