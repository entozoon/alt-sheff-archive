		<td>Everyone is welcome to this Sheffield Humanist Society meeting with human rights campaigner Maryam Namazie, speaking about the One Law for All campaign which opposes the use of Sharia and other religious ‘courts’ in the UK. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16522447">A recent item on the BBC News site</a> about the growth of these courts emphasises the need for the campaign. Sharia law is practised in Britain on a ‘voluntary’ and sometimes legally binding basis. Women from a Muslim background, who may lack knowledge of English and their rights under British law, can be pressured into using these ‘courts’. Refusal to abide by their rulings can give rise to ostracism, threats and intimidation. The One Law for All Campaign aims to guarantee equal rights for all.

Maryam is spokesperson for a number of Human Rights organisations including the One Law for All Campaign, Equal Rights Now and the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain.
