		<td>Microstories Exhibition

An exhibition of sound, writing and drawings of stories that represent a snap shot of what it is like living with the rare respiratory condition pulmonary hypertension. The issues covered, however are also applicable to other chronic illnesses and may resonate with those suffering from many long-term conditions. We ask people at the exhibition to respond to the stories and add their own words or drawings, aiming to help and encourage people to communicate and understand what it is like living with illness.</td>
