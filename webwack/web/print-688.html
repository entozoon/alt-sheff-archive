		<td>A celebration of Black History Month, October 2017, organised by Our Mel co-hosted by Gabriela Thompson Menanteaux and Annalisa Toccara. Our Mel is a grassroots volunteer community dedicated to exploring cultural identity, Black history and what it means to be a person of colour in Britain today. Inspired by two local lasses on a journey of self-love, Our Mel was born in November 2016 over a pack of caramel biscuits and a cup of tea - Yorkshire of course.

Events for Black History Month could be happening near you; 31 days poetry/open mic, art exhibitions, dance, music, seminars, drama, speakers, workshops and film. Workshops include opportunities for people of all ages, races and religious backgrounds to gather together in a safe environment to discuss and learn about everyday issues surrounding people of colour in todayâ€™s society.

Full schedule and more information will be available on the website, or email <a href=_a.html href="mailto:info@ourmel.org.uk">info@ourmel.org.uk</a>.
