		<td>The Women´s Construction Centre (WICAT) is moving from Burngreave and starting an exciting new partnership with Endeavour on Earl Marshall Rd, Grimesthorpe. This is brilliant for WICAT - not only for putting on classes again, but also because they have developed an extremely positive relationship with Endeavour, and can see some great opportunities for partnership work for the future. Endeavour works with young people who are struggling to fit in to mainstream education, they offer a safe and friendly space to learn, and are keen to offer as many opportunities as possible in order to strengthen the life chances of these young people. WICAT will be extremely proud to be involved in this work in any way. 

WICAT will be putting together a new programme of construction and DIY classes after this move, starting late October. But if you are free this weekend to help with the final push, there will be plenty of jobs - big and small - including cleaning, tidying, garden tidying etc. It is also a chance to root through their giveaway stash. Lots of free stuff, from office stuff to furniture to weird bits that would come in handy for someone somewhere! Don´t miss out!! Lunch will be provided. 

If you can make it please let them know so they have an idea of numbers for food etc. Please email <a href="mailto:wicat2011@gmail.com">wicat2011@gmail.com</a> and let them know ASAP. (Note, the location, 21 Buckenham Street is shared with the Hindu Samaj). Thanks a lot, from The WICAT team.
