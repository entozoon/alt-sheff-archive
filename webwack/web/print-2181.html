		<td>Join a large demonstartion against UKIP as a party of bigots, sexists, Islamophobes, homophobes and people prejudiced against disabled people. UKIP represents the interests of big business and bankers who caused the economic crisis. It has built up its electoral base by both presenting itself as a party opposed to the European Union, but more importantly by spreading poisonous lies and hatred towards migrants and Muslims.

As usual an economic crisis is followed by a rise in racism and scapegoating of immigrants, this is a familiar pattern.

Getting to Doncaster by bus takes 80 minutes (X78 service) and by train 30 minutes. There is also a coach leaving Sheffield at 10.30am, from Paternoster Row, seats: £5/£2.50 concessions.
