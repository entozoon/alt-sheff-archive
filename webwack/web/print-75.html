		<td>The group promoting Universal Basic Income holds a social afternoon, a good chance to meet them or get involved. Both Labour and the Green Party are taking seriously the idea of UBI, it looks like Sheffield might be one of the places it first takes off, thanks to UBI Lab Sheffield.

South Street Kitchen is accessible, and 2 minutes walk from the station, in part of Park Hill Flats.
