		<td>In the struggle against fossil fuels the Radcliffe 26 were arrested for something like thinking about plotting to disrupt a power station ... a ridiculous charge which is being challenged in court. George Monbiot and Caroline Lucas will be among the witnesses for the defence, but even so the decision could have big implications for police power against legitimate protest. The accused include local people and this gig is to raise money for the legal costs. <ul><li>Soundwaves (jazz)</li><li>Leather Zoo (rock)</li><li>DJ</li><li>and more</li><li>LICENSED BAR</li></ul>Tickets £5 (£4 concs)
