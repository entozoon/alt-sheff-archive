		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A conference discussing the Â£4 billion Government AASC (Asylum Accommodation and Support Services Contracts) from 2019 to 2029. Various Parliamentary Committees have confirmed what asylum tenants know only too well: <strong>G4S and Serco asylum housing is disgraceful and unacceptable</strong>. 

South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG) helped make the film <a href="https://vimeo.com/201062637">"The Asylum Market"</a> last year showing how G4S intimidate tenants who complain, but it looks like the Government is happy to see them take more taxpayers money to provide slum housing for asylum tenants. <strong>SYMAAG want to stop them. This conference will discuss how. </strong>

The Sanctuary, Chapel Walk, Sheffield S1 2PD is opposite the Crucible Theatre, 10 mins walk from bus/train stations. Please arrive 10.30am for 11am start. The event is free but please let SYMAAG know if intend to come, as places are limited. Email <a href="dignitynotdetention%40yahoo.co.html">dignitynotdetention@yahoo.co.uk</a>. Do not let a lack of money stop you coming to SYMAAG events. Bring your ticket to the event and SYMAAG can reimburse you in cash for reasonable travel expenses, or contact them in advance.
