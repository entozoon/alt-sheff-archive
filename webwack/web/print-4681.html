		<td>Following on from last weeks Brit flick Cinema Syndicate is taking you further back into British Cinema in 'It Happened Here'

It is the Second World War. The Nazis have invaded Britain. There is a split between the resistance and those who prefer to collaborate with the invaders for a quiet life. The protagonist, a nurse, is caught in the middle.

There will be some discussion following the film about the issues raised and any thoughts on the film.
