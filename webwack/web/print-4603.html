		<td>All women are welcome to join this vigil which is publicising the disproportionate effect climate change will have and is having already on women. There will be a letter for people to send to their MP asking her or him to put pressure on the government to ensure that women and women's organisations are included in climate change negotiations at local, national and international level so that women's interests are adequately addressed.
