		<td>All women are welcome to participate in this vigil which is protesting against the current rule that women who have come to the UK from another country on the basis of marriage to a British citizen are not allowed public housing or benefits until their immigration status is regularised. This means these women are economically dependent on the settled spouse or partner  When women in this situation flee domestic violence they are ineligible for benefits or re-housing. To get a place in a Refuge, women have to be eligible for Housing Benefit and Income Support. Thus this group of women are often turned away.
 
At the vigil there will be a letter for people to sign asking their MP to ask the government to abolish the so-called 'no recourse to public funds' requirement for abused women who have insecure status and suggesting several changes which would also support these women.
