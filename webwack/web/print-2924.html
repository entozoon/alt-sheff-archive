		<td>A long-running community celebration put together annually by a small group of volunteers based in Ecclesfield, Chapeltown and the surrounding areas. Lots of family fun and entertainment, stalls with books, bric-a-brac, records, CDs, raffle and more. A great day out, which also raises money for MacMillan Cancer Support, and Ecclesfield and surrounding communities.
