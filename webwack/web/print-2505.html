		<td>WDM aims to change the actions, policies and institutions of governments, corporations and wealthy minorities, which are preventing an end to poverty and injustice. Part of a global movement, it works alongside people protesting in the developing world. 

Current campaigning includes "Get the banks out of coal." Coal is a major contributor to climate change. Open pit coal mines are responsible for vast destruction and forced displacements of whole communities in the developing world. The problems are exacerbated by the UK financial sector which is funding a coal boom in the global south with investments worth billions of pounds.
