		<th>Details</th>
		<td>"Live" presents experimental and non-traditional work that specifically acknowledges the presence of the audience and plays with the ‘liveness’ of theatre. Expect a night of bold, experimental and uncompromising work that tackles a wide range of issues, agendas and ideas - not another ‘new writing’ night. A challenging but fun night, where artists can share new work and audiences can meet them, chat and collectively feedback on the work. 

This is a ‘Pay What You Decide‘ performance.
