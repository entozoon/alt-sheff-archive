		<td>Positive Money is a campaign to create a money and banking system that works FOR society and not against it. They meet the last Monday of each month, and the next event is a talk by Dermot Smyth on "Positive Money in Context"

As the Positive Money campaign continues to make steady progress, questions inevitably arise about the knock-on effects of monetary reform. 

* Will the speculative activities of shadow banking in any way subvert or circumvent a transparent, genuinely democratic system of sovereign money? 

* Will other progressive reforms be required to fully benefit from monetary reform? For example, should UK set up German-type public banks (Sparkassen) which are neither private nor directly controlled by the state?

* Could ‘transitional initiatives’ like cooperatives, local currencies, LETS or not-for-profit organisations in general, be the way to fully benefit from PM’s core proposals?

Please come to this meeting and bring your thoughts on these questions. There will be plenty of time for discussion.

Voluntary donations requested (suggested £3) to cover costs
