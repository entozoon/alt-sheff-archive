		<td>One Billion Rising is a global campaign to stop violence against women and girls – from V-day 14th February every year. Don’t just feel angry and powerless in the face of blatant sexism, misogyny, and survivors’ stories of abuse and exploitation, here’s a chance to take a stand alongside thousands of others around the world, show your solidarity, and celebrate the strength and courage of survivors. This year’s global theme is SOLIDARITY.

Sheffield Rising are adding a new dance in solidarity with women in Chile who have taken to the streets to protest against human rights violations during the current political unrest – many have been targeted by police with sexual violence and some have been blinded by rubber bullets.

All welcome: women and children will dance in the centre, and men who support us are welcome to cheer on from the front and sides. Dress code: where possible, please wear black with red/pink/orange (women in Chile also wear symbolic ‘blindfolds’). Red ribbons for wrists will be available on the day. 

See weblinks below to watch the dance videos and practise.
