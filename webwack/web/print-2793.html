		<td>Project Sunshine: How Science Can Use the Sun to Fuel and Feed the World, with Professor Tony Ryan and Steve McKevitt. It’s an astonishing fact that capturing all the energy in just one hour’s worth of sunlight would enable us to meet the planet’s food and energy needs for an entire year. Project Sunshine tells how scientists are working to reconnect us to the ‘solar economy’, harnessing the power of the sun and ending dependence on ‘fossilised sunshine’ in the form of coal, oil and gas.

Tony Ryan and Steve McKevitt take us through history to see how our world became the place it is today, before moving on to the cutting-edge science and technology that will enable us to live happily in a sustainable future.

Professor Tony Ryan OBE is the Pro-Vice Chancellor for Science at the University of Sheffield where he leads Project Sunshine. Steve McKevitt is an expert in consumerism and communications, an author and government adviser on business innovation.

In collaboration with University of Sheffield Student’s Union in association with the University of Sheffield Public Engagement with Research Team. £8/£6.50 (concessions) Tickets are available from The Arena Ticket Shop.
