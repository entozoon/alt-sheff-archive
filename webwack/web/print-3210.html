		<td>Friends of the Earth Sheffield Group are people from all walks of life who share a common concern for the state of the planet and a desire to do something about it. Current issues are the Sheffield Incinerator (see News tab on this website) and "Energy We Can All Afford" - a new and positive approach to this based on energy efficiency and clean sustainable energy. This campaign  aims to influence the new Energy Bill, to get money from carbon taxes used to make our homes super-energy efficient and to boost local interest and engagement with these issues.
