		<td>This year Cinema Palestino at the Showroom is screening two major award-winning new films by well-known Palestinian women filmmakers.

This film, directed  by Hind Shoufani, is a journey to discover family history, much of which had been hidden from her and her sister. Her father was the highly esteemed Palestinian intellectual and academic, Dr Elias Shoufani (1932-2013). After 1967 Shoufani joined the PLO, but went on to instigate an intifada against Yasser Arafat.
