		<td>Sheffield Stop the War Coalition invites members, supporters and delegates from affiliated parties and groups to come along and discuss and plan how to best organise and campaign in 2018.

Trump has now cancelled his announced visit to Britain - for the second time. This is a great new year victory for mass mobilisation, through which even the president of the United States can be successfully confronted. This development opens up the argument about foreign policy as it is now clearly no longer a question of Britain seeing the "special relationship" with the US as inevitable. 

The Stop the War Coalition has a real opportunity to advance the case for a new, peaceful foreign policy in 2018. It will also be organising around the Stop the Wars national tour, holding a public meeting on the theme "Why we need an anti-war government" in the next few months.
