		<td>DLA Piper host events like this for people to have fun and help ’decision-makers’, and to be better informed. This one is about ’key issues’ in elderly people’s lives: financial austerity; ageing populations; housing crisis; high cost of falls in the over 60s; "asset rich, income poor"; fuel poverty and deep poverty; sale of family assets for basic survival.  

Speakers:
Rosalind Eve, Chief Executive, Age UK Sheffield
John Grant, Senior Lecturer, Sheffield Hallam University 
Teresa Hitchcock, Partner, DLA Piper LLP
Eddie Murphy, Technical Director, Mott MacDonald
Jacques Pender, Head of Automation & Robotics, Sheffield Hallam University
Facilitators: Perry Walker & Wendy Stern

Based on Crowd Wise, developed by Perry Walker while at New Economics Foundation (nef), designed to help people reach consensus on tricky issues. It asks a simple question, uses four to six ’policy options’ with expert briefings and small group work. You advocate your option and cast your vote with preference voting. Some people will work in groups on their preference while others have to ’play a role’. Preference voting encourages people who disagree to speak constructively by explaining their group’s option to the other groups so that consensus can be reached by  group mergers or amending options to be more ’appealing’.

The venue is opposite the Peace Gardens between Cafe Nero and Cafe Rouge. Booking free but note £15 Standard Charge for anyone who books a place without giving 48 hours’ notice if cancelled.

Action for Involvement creates space for people to get together with key policy makers. Personal data is retained for their sole use but photographs or video clips may be used in publicity, newsletters or websites by them or their various funders and/or project partners.
