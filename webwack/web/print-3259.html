		<td>The volunteers are again organising Sheffield’s annual free festival for June 2013. Profits go to good causes and it’s a fantastic event. Don’t be shy if you want to get involved or have any ideas, come along to one of the open meetings, last Wednesday of each month, these are open to everybody. (They also sensibly have closed meetings for those already involved in planning, to reduce time spent on introductions and increase time spent on getting things done).
