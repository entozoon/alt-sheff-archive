		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A salon-style event with a panel of four local expert clinical and academic speakers, hosted by Sheffield Save our NHS and Sheffield Medsin. 

Speakers:
Dr Jenny Swann, GP and academic specialist in primary care
Dr Jack Czauderna, retired GP, Sheffield Equality Group
Professor Mark Gamsu, LMU and Sheffield CCG lay member
Professor John Carlisle, Sheffield Hallam University 

The discussion will cover what needs to happen in order to preserve an NHS true to its founding principles as a public and universal service with free access at the point of healthcare delivery. We know the NHS needs more money, but should it change in other ways? Why must we preserve universal access to healthcare against the threat of user charges? The looming crisis in general practice. Why competitive tendering is not the way to improve healthcare. How can we achieve proper accountability for health spending and services? 

Refreshments from 6.30pm (50p). Presentations start at 7pm.

Part of the build-up to the national People’s March for the NHS, organised by the Darlington Mums’ group, which is coming through Sheffield on August 25th and 26th. Watch out for more details here and at <a href="http://www.sheffieldsaveournhs.co.uk/">www.sheffieldsaveournhs.co.uk</a>.</td>
