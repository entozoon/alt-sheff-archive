		<td>An opportunity to celebrate International Women&#39;s Day while cycling. This a very easy ride along the Trans Pennine Trail link route (NCN6) to Oughtibridge via Hillsborough Park through beautiful Beeley Woods, with flapjack and a cafe stop in Oughtibridge before returning around 1pm. The riders will take a very gentle pace to enjoy the friendly company and the scenery.
