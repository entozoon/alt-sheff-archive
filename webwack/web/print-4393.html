		<td>A Sheffield Unite Against Fascism meeting on the theme "Don't let David Cameron divide us: challenge racist mythology and celebrate our multicultural society"

Speaker: Danny Dorling: Professor of Human Geography, Sheffield University and author of 'Injustice: Why Social Inequality Persists'. Danny will explain how racism and economic inequality rather than multiculturalism are causing division in our society.

Please spread the word about this timely debate on how we can maintain the unity of Sheffield in the face of the racism being given ever greater legitimacy by sections of the media and some mainstream politicians.
