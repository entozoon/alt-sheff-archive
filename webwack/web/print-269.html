		<td>Rising global military expenditure ($1739billion) isn’t helping the world feel safer. It’s time for a new approach – grounded in the well-being of people and planet, and rooted in solidarity, justice and appreciation of our inter-dependence. Using participative methods, CRESST (Conflict Resolution Education in Schools) and SCRAP (Sheffield Creative Action for Peace) explore new thinking and ways to grow the conversation.
