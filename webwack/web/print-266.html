		<td>Towns across the country are bringing in landlord licensing. Sheffield only has a few areas, yet many people are suffering from terrible housing conditions. The Council gives only a slow-moving, half-hearted response. Cllr. Steinke has failed to commit to city-wide licensing. Now, ACORN Sheffield Branch will be planning to ramp-up demands and force the Council to listen. Come along to help plan the next steps.
