		<td>Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign have called this march to Sheffield Law Court, to mark the first anniversary of Amber Rudd’s shocking decision not to hold any form of inquiry into the infamous “Battle of Orgreave”. 95 miners were beaten up, and falsely imprisoned 33 years ago, apparently by orders of the Conservative government. Amber Rudd’s decision was made on Halloween. 

Join this Halloween night rally against the evil of the past and present. Fancy dress optional but encouraged. Full details including downloadable stuff (available to order, £10 per pack of materials) at the link below.
