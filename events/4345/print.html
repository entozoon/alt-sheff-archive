		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A social for people interested in environment and community in Sheffield. Discussion on topics such as the Sheffield council tree felling programme, universal basic income, the results of the Paris climate talks and anything else people want to discuss. This is a casual drinks event so you are also welcome to just come and set your own conversation or hang out in the bar selling a range of drinks including beers made on the premises in the Regather Brewery.

While many Sheffield Green Party members will be there, the event is non-partisan, open to all and they encourage anyone who is interested in activism and supporting their local community to come along and join in.

Free Entry. Runs from 7pm until 10pm. Bring a friend or two and enjoy some relaxed discussions. If you would like to bring snacks feel free to.
