		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride offers a bit of fun, a monthly evening bike ride for anyone to join in. Their motto? "We have nothing to lose but our chains!" (But bring locks and lights, just in case).

This time the ride is on the theme of The Women’s Movement in Sheffield, to celebrate International Women’s Day (March 8) by cycling to locations in Sheffield associated with the struggle for women's emancipation.
