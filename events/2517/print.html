		<td>People suffer and struggle and don’t realise that it is not because of their own fecklessness and inadequacy but because of the way that our society is organised and financed. Only if we work together can we change things. Everyone is welcome to everything. A commitment to pursue fairness and equality is fundamental to the Occupy movement. The founding principle of Occupy is that the current system is unsustainable. It is undemocratic and unjust. We need alternatives.

People’s Forum, as well as speakers from<ul><li>Sheffield Equality Group, on wealth and poverty in Sheffield</li><li>Positive Money, on the banking system and debt</li><li>Fir Vale Food bank, on personal debt </li></ul>
Free – just turn up. Bring a picnic lunch.
