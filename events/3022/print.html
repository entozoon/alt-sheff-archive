		<td>Outwardly, we live in a society that appears more open-minded and tolerant than at any time in our history. But, how far does this tolerance really extend? Do we now tolerate everything but the intolerant beliefs of others? This panel and audience discussion explores interpretations of tolerance in history in order to open up what tolerance means today. 

Speakers are: 
Frank Füredi, Professor of Sociology at the University of Kent
Angie Hobbs, Professor for the Public Understanding of Philosophy at the University of Sheffield
Anthony Milton, Professor of History at the University of Sheffield
