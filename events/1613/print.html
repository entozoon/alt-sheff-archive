		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Rotherham Federation of Tenants and Residents (RotherFed) is running a 5 week campaigning and influencing course to help people run successful campaigns that can make a difference in their community. The course is friendly and informal and open to all, facilitated by Steve Ruffle. All the sessions are held on Wednesday afternoons. People can attend all sessions or just the ones they are interested in.  The sessions are free of charge and are open to all but places need to be booked. 

This is the second session, and will include a Panel Discussion on Campaigning, Influencing and Democracy. Hopefully this will be a lively afternoon with questions, answers and real debate and discussion. 

To book your place on any of the sessions email <a href="mailto:info@rotherfed.org">info@rotherfed.org</a> or phone 01709 368515.</td>
