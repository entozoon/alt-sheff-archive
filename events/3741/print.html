		<th>Details</th>
		<td>ASSIST is a volunteer led charity which which supports people in Sheffield who have been made homeless and destitute whilst seeking asylum in the UK.  Every year, thousands of people fleeing their homeland to seek asylum are instead driven into hardship and further suffering by the UK's inadequate and unfair asylum system. Many genuine claims are refused and very little official support is given, leaving people with no right to work, no access to benefits and no accommodation. ASSIST offers: a friendly and trusting environment; accommodation; cash for necessities; advocacy and referrals to food banks, medical treatment and legal assistance; signposting to free social, educational, exercise and volunteering opportunities.

ASSIST simply could not operate without our incredible network of friends and supporters, and we want to take this opportunity to celebrate the achievements of the last year together with you, as well as look at our plans for what we know will be a challenging year ahead. 

This year we will be joined by our keynote speaker Mike Kaye, Advocacy Manager of Still Human Still Here; a destitution network of which ASSIST has recently become a part, who will be speaking on trends affecting destitution nationally; Jochen Kortlander, our Accommodation Development Worker, will update us on our own housing project, and there will be a panel discussion regarding accommodation options for ASSIST.

We will be having food and refreshments towards the end of the evening and we would welcome any donations of food for sharing. 

Please indicate to us if you are planning to attend by responding via either email to office@assistsheffield.org.uk or by phone on 0114 275 4960.</td>
