		<td>A 'Ride For Life' course will be running in Firth Park 29th April to 10th June 2010

In 2009 and 2010, dozens of adults of all ages started cycling again thanks to special FREE courses, (run by Sheffield’s cycling cooperative, Pedal Ready, supported by Sheffield Council and CTC, the national cycling organisation, and sponsored by NHS Sheffield). Improve your fitness, lose weight and guard against heart disease, stress and some forms of cancer, all just by cycling more often. 

Ride for Life is an easy going weekly cycling course for adults of any age, run by professional cycling instructors. Just bring yourself (and a packed lunch if possible). Bikes are provided. The courses will run for seven weeks. Places must be booked beforehand at <a href="mailto:admin@pedalready.co.uk">admin@pedalready.co.uk</a> or tel. 2412775.</td>
