		<td>Critical Mass is the monthly cycle ride in celebration of the bicycle as the most efficient, peaceful and perfect mode of transport ever invented. It usually happens on the last Friday of each month, wonder who will turn out on the last day of the year to delight the shoppers in the sales? 

It may set off from from Sheffield Town Hall or the Concourse, University of Sheffield, Western Bank, so get in touch if you want to confirm.
