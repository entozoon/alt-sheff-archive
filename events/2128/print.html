Live broadcast and discussion by Analogous Frequencies, a space to discuss the potential of broadcast media and their complex relation to the market, the state and civil society. The broadcast will address Sheffield&#39;s history of activism and DIY culture, pirate and community-led media along with a broader discussion around local and global media structures, focusing particularly on the political efficacy and aesthetic dimensions of radio. 

The panel includes:
Sangita Basudev (Sheffield Live)
Jake Harries (FAVTR/Zero Dollar Laptop/Access Space/formerly FON/CHAKK)
Lee Ford (BBC Radio Leeds)
Professor John Mowitt (Radio: Essays in Bad Reception)

Homeland is a collaboration between Cat Moir, a researcher in the humanities, and artists Robert Quirk, Charlotte A Morgan and and Terry Slater. The event is commissioned as part of PlastiCities, in association with the University of Sheffield, and supported by Access Space.
