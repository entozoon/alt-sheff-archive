		<td>Permaculture is an approach to land use design based on the relationships found in natural ecologies. It combines social change with sustainability to maximise effect and minimise work. This non-residential training will cover the full design course syllabus, with a focus on urban resilience. Working in partnership with <a href="http://hazelhurst.coop/">Hazelhurst CSA</a> (Community Supported Agriculture) it will provide opportunities for practical design and implementation. 

Teachers: Suzi High and Joe Atkinson plus apprentices. They can help with accommodation if you are travelling from out of town.
