		<td>Positive Money is a campaign to democratise money and banking, so that it works for society and not against it. This month "Positive Money at the Crossroads?" Speaker Dermot Smyth, a supporter of Positive Money (Sheffield), followed by discussion. 

Positive Money is making steady progress in UK and internationally. Success depends on individuals from different political positions continuing to campaign around common aims. But, as its influence grows, these differences may become sharper. For example, should it have a close relationship with campaigns like New Economics Foundation or New Economic Perspectives in USA? Should it formally support UKUncut, 38 Degrees or Occupy?

The UK Green Party has already adopted Positive Money’s ideas, and several Labour and Conservative MPs support it. This is welcome, but, what if an extremist party signed up? In USA, there is vociferous criticism of the banks from the Republican ‘Tea Party’ movement

What to do at the Crossroads? Turn right or left? In which direction lies radical and effective banking reform? Is there any advantage in discussing this dilemma before the crossroads is actually reached? 

The monthly meetings provide an open and inclusive space for supporters to meet like-minded people in a friendly environment and to debate the questions around the money system. Attendance is usually 15-20. Refreshments (50p) from 7.15, talk starts at 7.30pm. Donation of £3 per head requested to cover costs.
