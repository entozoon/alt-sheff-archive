		<th>Details</th>
		<td>South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG) and friends and partners in other organisations hope to build on the coming-together of refugee support/campaign groups and migrant activists. There is added urgency to this work given the increase in racism, xenophobia and attacks on refugees and migrants since the EU Referendum.

Individuals and representatives of organisations are welcome as are your ideas and plans for the priorities for all of us in the next year. Feel free to invite other individuals or reps of organisations in South Yorkshire you think would be interested. We work better together especially in these challenging times for refugee/migrant communities, campaigners and anti-racists.

Doors open at 6.15. Please arrive in time for a prompt 6.30 start. There will be a refreshment break at 7.30.
They will also be taking a collection to help pay for room hire. Do not let lack of money be a barrier to attending any SYMAAG events. Bring your ticket/receipt to the meeting and they can reimburse you in cash at the meeting for any reasonable travel expenses. Or get in touch before the meeting if you need to.
