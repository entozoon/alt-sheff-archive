What if:<ul><li>The things you were taught don&#39;t make sense anymore?</li><li>Speaking the truth meant losing your community?
 </li><li>Following your heart meant doing the impossible?</li></ul>Peaceable Kingdom explores the interconnected life journeys of farmed animals, former farmers, and animal rescuers struggling against an out-of-control industrial system. Breaking generations of silence in the farming community, Peaceable Kingdom weaves together themes of respect, forgiveness, commitment and healing, offering a vision of a more peaceful world that is well within our reach. 

Â£3 entry and cheap vegan food for sale. 
Food from 6.30pm. Film on at 8pm.
 
All proceeds from this event will go towards the Sheffield Vegan Approach - an event supporting people to go vegan for a month. More info at: <a href="http://www.theveganapproach.com/">www.theveganapproach.com</a></td>
