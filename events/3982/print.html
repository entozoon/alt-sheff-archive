		<td>Jon Snow has called this film "One of the most remarkable and moving documentaries I have seen, about this unreported story. The tragedy of the Palestinians encapsulated in the life of one family and one town - Bethlehem. See the film, then go to Bethlehem and see for yourself." The film was shot over five years and captures the city of Bethlehem as it has never been seen before. This is an emotional journey of one woman&#39;s fight for her home town.

This film is on show in Sheffield for one night only.
