		<td>Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, typically about a common belief that can be demonstrated to be false or cannot be justified by the available evidence.

This is a meeting in addition to the main programme of speakers, more informal to enable those present to be more actively involved. Possible activities are debates in which people attending (with prior arrangement) are welcome to take the floor and invite discussion of a particular topic of skeptical interest, report on events that they have attended, and so on.
