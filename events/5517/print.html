		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The first Seed Swap of 2019, including lectures and demonstrations on subjects like growing in small spaces, how to graft fruit trees, and alternative food networks. Whether you’ve been saving your own seeds, hoarding packets, or fancy getting into growing, come along to this friendly free event to start swapping.

There will be help, advice and inspiration to help you grow your  seeds, and learn how to save them in the future. By buying ‘real seeds‘ as opposed to F1 hybrids (of which the seeds can’t be saved) you can help keep these special varieties alive for generations to come.
