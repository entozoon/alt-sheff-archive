		<td>Repair Sheffield are holding another Repair Café at the Farm - the antidote to our throw-away society! Do you have something which needs fixing but you don’t know how? Come along to the Repair Café and ask one of their fixers to help you.

Are you a fixer yourself? They’d love you to come along and share your knowledge with everyone. If you are a local reputable repair business please feel free to get in touch too, they want to promote all avenues of repair. If we all start learning how and where we can repair household items and clothes it will reduce the amount of landfill and it will support local businesses.

Session in Heeley City Farm, in Reception Classroom by the Duck Pond. For more information please ring the Farm on Sheff 2580482 or email <a href="mailto:s.hardy@heeleyfarm.org.uk">s.hardy@heeleyfarm.org.uk</a>
