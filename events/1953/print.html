		<td>Sexism is prejudice or discrimination based on gender, or conditions or attitudes that foster stereotypes of social roles based on gender. With women&#39;s unemployment at the highest level in 23 years and rising faster than men&#39;s, women will be hardest hit as services and benefits are cut. Sheffield council have recently approved Spearmint Rhino&#39;s application for a new license. The owner of Spearmint Rhino said last year that he thought students should &#39;strip to pay fees&#39;. Strip clubs perpetuate the idea that women are sexual objects, and these ideas can be extremely harmful. 

Sheffield Against Sexism fights sexism in Sheffield, campaigning against more strip clubs opening in the city and to save our local women&#39;s services. They encourage all ages, genders and faiths to join the protest, attend the demonstration and the planning meetings held in the run-up to the event.
