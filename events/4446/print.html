		<td>Our food supplies are threatened by war, biofuels, and climate chaos. And even when they work they often express the devil-take-the-planet logic of globalised corporations. Can we build local alternatives? Sheffield is home to lots of positive initiatives in this direction. This meetup aims to bring together people working towards local, clean and fair food - partly to learn more about the various angles, and specifically to boost impact by combining social media efforts.

The meeting will be joined (by Skype) by Estelle Brown, social media supremo from Incredible Edible Todmorden (IET). She has helped IET gain a global profile, mostly through her tireless and effective use of social media. Also by David Rüder, an established media and communications professional, with twenty years of web and internet experience and a broad range of skills from linguistics to graphic design. David is currently a newswriter with a PR and social media agency in the Hope Valley. 

 If you´re working for better food in Sheffield and you´d like to say hello and learn a little more, then please go along. Organised by a group of people around Aquaponics Lab and Sheffield University who are starting off some projects locally.
