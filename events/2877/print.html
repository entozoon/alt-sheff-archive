It aims to highlight female and LGBTQ art, projects and activism in the community, promoting social change in a non-discriminatory environment.

Weston Park is a 5 min walk from Sheffield University tram stop. Coming by train, just hop on the blue route supertram from the train station. At Weston Park, meet by the bandstand.
