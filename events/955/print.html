		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The Global Poverty Project's '1.4 Billion reasons' is a thought-provoking presentation that is traveling the world, inspiring and empowering audiences in its path. Based on leading research, it clearly communicates the reality of extreme poverty and demonstrates that by making simple changes everyone can be a part of the solution. Graeme Hodge, the assistant international development director of the Salvation Army, will be delivering the presentation.

It is the first event organised (and open to all) by The Exchange, a part of Sheffield University's Politics Society responsible for organizing public speakers to lecture at the Students Union.
