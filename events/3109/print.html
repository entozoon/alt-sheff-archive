		<td>Abundance is a project to harvest local fruit left because people do not notice them, or cannot harvest them. A team of volunteers help to gather city fruit and redistribute on a non-profit basis to community cafes, nurseries, Surestarts and individuals. They also make juice, jams, chutneys and preserves.

Abundance has been active in Sheffield since 2007. As a result many volunteers, artists and creatives have produced artworks on the Abundance theme. This exhibition will celebrate this body of work, along with new pieces and launch Abundance Week 2013 (annual end of season festivities).

There will be film screenings, live music and refreshments available.
