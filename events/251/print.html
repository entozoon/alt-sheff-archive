		<td>Come and discuss the people's campaign to reclaim the land and our rights to make decisions on community issues. The Earth Centre should be a site that demonstrates alternative energy systems that society needs, to preserve the environment.

The Earth Centre was a multimillion pound project with clear aims to be used as an educational facility for the community, but it has been squandered and left to rot. It is currently been used by war-game enthusiasts. It was closed down because it was not breaking-even, mainly due to the over-reliance on the project being a tourist-mecca, but also the mis-spending of money throughout the project's existence. If the centre had been run with more involvement of local people, it may not have turned into the white elephant it is today.  

The Council has refused to hold a public meeting, and blocked requests from local community groups to harvest the fruit and medicinal plants, turning their backs on this opportunity to safeguard our children's future. So the people are holding their own meeting. Please come along and support the campaign to reclaim the rights to decide what happens in our own communities. Have your say, power to the people, together we can make postive change!
