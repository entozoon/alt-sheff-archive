		<td>A series of actions in protest are being organised following the Co-Operative Bank decision to close several accounts of Palestine solidarity groups, including three local ones. These include Sheffield Palestine Women&#39;s Scholarship Fund (which currently supports 43 Palestinian women to go to university in the Gaza Strip, one of the worldâ€™s poorest regions) and Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign. They are calling for people to join them on this first "Closing our accounts" protest. 

Please spread the word to anyone who may be able to join in. You do not have to have a personal account with the Co-op - you may just want to make a complaint as a supporter. They are hoping that Look North will cover the protest, in response to a press release. There is also going to be an article in Sheffield Star.
