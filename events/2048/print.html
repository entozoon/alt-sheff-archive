		<th>Details</th>
		<td>There has been an upsurge in countries asserting jurisdiction over alleged crimes commited via the Internet from other parts of the world. People like Richard O&#39;Dwyer, Gary McKinnon and Kim Dotcom are facing extradition for their actions online despite the authorities in their home countries having taken no interest in prosecuting their allegedly criminal or tortuous behaviour.

Has the internet changed the nature of international crime? Is the law keeping pace? Is justice being done?

The topic will be introduced by Deborah Adshead, a lecturer in Computing at Sheffield Hallam University who taught part of Richard O&#39;Dwyer&#39;s course, followed by discussion of the implications for our digital rights and what action we could take.

All welcome!</td>
