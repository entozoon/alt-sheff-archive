		<td>ASSIST supports destitute asylum seekers in Sheffield by providing accommodation, food and support to those in most need or distress. Meet current volunteers and find out more about the different volunteer roles at ASSIST. Chat about what might suit you, and maybe apply to be a volunteer. 

  The ASSIST office in Victoria Hall is accessed from Chapel Walk, opposite the Superdrug store. The event runs from 4pm to 6pm in Room 43. Please note: The same presentation will be repeated twice, at 10 minutes past each hour (at 4.10pm and 5.10pm), so choose the one that is best for you.

To find out more, phone Sheff 2754960 or email <a href="mailto:volunteer@assistsheffield.org.uk">volunteer@assistsheffield.org.uk</a>.
