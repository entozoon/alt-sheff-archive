		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A cinematic essay in defense of remembering, exploring the Spanish colonization of California and the Mexican-American War alongside intimate reflections on nostalgia, butch identity and Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo. Omitting the depiction of a single human body, the film combines rigorous historical research with a lyrical stream-of-consciousness monologue, set against landscapes of urban California.

Part of Sheffield Fringe 2016: Object Documentary. The biennial Sheffield Fringe 2016 is held at Bloc Projects, in Sheffield’s Cultural Industries Quarter, coinciding with Sheffield International Documentary Film Festival (Doc/Fest). A nine-day programme of film screenings, talks and performances. Many of the short documentaries and artists’ films have very interesting politically and socially engaged content. 

All events are free and booking is not required.
