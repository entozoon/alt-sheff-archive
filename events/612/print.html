		<td>Creating change, achieving justice. Activist gathering and 40th anniversary party of the World Development Movement. In the 40 years since WDM was founded in 1970, they've helped to create real change for some of the world's poorest people. But there's still a long way to go to achieve global justice. Now, with the threat of climate change looming and the power of international financial institutions undiminished despite the economic crisis, this Activist Gathering will examine how we can challenge power structures that keep people poor. 

The event starts at 10.30 with registration, tea and coffee, followed by a  keynote speech by Paul Mason, BBC Newsnight's economics editor at 11am. The gathering finishes at 6pm, then from 7pm celebrate the 40th anniversary and the campaign successes achieved with buffet dinner, locally brewed beer and live music.
