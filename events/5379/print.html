		<td>E.D.E.N Film Productions are proud to announce Transforming Cinema 2018, a trans-focused film festival, championing the voices, experiences and talents of transgender, gender non-conforming, non-binary and genderqueer individuals and communities. It will include film screenings and workshops across the weekend at various venues. Other events will be taking place in Sheffield to mark Trans Awareness Week and the International Transgender Day of Remembrance.

Chair Tom Reaney says “Events like these are massively important in combatting ongoing overwhelming transphobic attitudes. Whether it’s negative media attention, so-called ‘debate’ on trans lives and existences, falsehoods, fears and scare-mongering being perpetrated through politics, in the media and in both LGBTQIA+ communities and non-LGBTQIA+ communities around the world – trans voices are being ignored whilst cis-gender fears are being elevated to dangerous prominence."
