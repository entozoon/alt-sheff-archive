		<td>George Monbiot is a great writer, Guardian columnist and mega-brain. In this speaking tour he is taking on all comers in a series of debates around the country. In the first half of every session, he'll start off by choosing a topic, laying out his case for a few minutes, then inviting people to try to knock it down. In the second half, the floor will be thrown open for any subject, any argument you want to have. Come and test your wits.
