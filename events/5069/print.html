		<td>The Palestine Marathon, held in Bethlehem, is over repeat laps requiring great endurance. This 24-hour non-stop group run is in solidarity with the people in Palestine who cannot move freely in their own land due to the multiple checkpoints, harassed by Israeli soldiers and settlers, and hindered by poor infrastructure.

To both honour their resolve and raise awareness locally, members of Sheffield PSC have teamed up with local community groups and individuals to organise it. It will also raise vital funds for children’s educational and play projects in Gaza and for Palestinian women to study at University.

Entrants can run, jog or walk in half hour shifts doing kilometre circuits of Meersbrook Park, coincidentally the same size as Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem. Diyar, a Palestinian Women’s football team touring the North at the time, will be opening the run. 

Families and friends of runners will be able to visit Meersbrook Park Community Walled Garden to view an acclaimed photographic exhibition of Palestinian life, listen to live music and poetry, and enjoy tea and cake. A run will take place in Gaza which will start just as this one finishes - a live video link up is planned.
