		<td>Oxjam Steel City&#39;s first event is a debut of Sheffield band Les Sessions du Confiture, who describe themselves as &#39;Cajun roots party music&#39;. They came about when Seth Tinsley (Tyde), Matt Quinn (Boombox Karavan, The Mighty Quinns) and Tom Wright (The Albion Band) got together to enjoy themselves. Drawing from their varied experience, the trio bring Cajun, Québécois, Blue Beat, Ska and rock styles to their varied, exciting sets. Imagine David Lindley, Little Feat, the Clash and Prince at a late night jam

They will be supported by traditional folk band, <a href="http://blackhares.co.uk/wp/">The Black Hares</a>

Oxjam unites a network of music-loving people to raise money to fight poverty and suffering around the world. Since the first festival in 2006, Oxjam has raised more than £1.75 million in total for Oxfam&#39;s work.
