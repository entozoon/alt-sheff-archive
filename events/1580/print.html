		<td>LaDIY Festival presents a first in a series of feminist film screenings, starting with Jamie Babbit's light hearted comedy approach to radical feminism in 'Itty Bitty Titty Committee' (2007).

Anna (Melonie Diaz) is a young lesbian high school graduate who still lives with her parents, and works as a receptionist in a plastic surgeon's office. She embarks on a wild ride when she hooks up with a cadre of ultra-radical feminist lesbians hell-bent on raising hell. But things get even more complicated when Anna falls in love with Sadie, the radical group's leader who's already involved with an older woman named Courtney.

Shot with a punk/'90s riot grrl asthetic on Super 8 and Super 16, and with a soundtrack including Heavens to Betsy, Bikini Kill, Le Tigre and Peaches, 'Itty Bitty Titty Committee' promises a crazy, funny, foul-mouthed, affectionate and entertaining journey into grass roots radical feminist culture.

Also a selection of delightful vegan food on offer!

FREE / Suggested Donation Â£3. All proceeds go towards funding the forthcoming LaDIY Festival in November.
