		<td>SYMAAG (South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group) unites refugee, asylum and migrant organisations with campaign groups and supporting individuals, for the rights of those seeking asylum and of those coming to work in this country. 
 
A major focus of their campaigning at the moment is highlighting the atrocious work of G4S, the bumbling security company which has been handed a massive contract for housing of asylum seekers.
