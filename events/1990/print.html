		<td>A Sheffield meeting about the dangers of genetically modified wheat. There will also be discussion of arrangements for getting to &#39;Take the flour back!&#39;, a public day of action against a genetically modified wheat trial at Rothamsted, Harpenden, Herts, on Sunday 27th May 2012.

Cow genes on toast anyone? No thanks! Bakers, farmers, growers, allotment holders, scientists, beekeepers, and people who eat food are turning out to voice their opposition to GM crops coming back to the UK. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=5NGx9t1Jq6U">To see a cartoon about the trials on YouTube click here</a> and read the information below the film. Come to the meeting or take your own action in your own way, at your own time. Together we can stop this trial.

What&#39;s up with the trial? It could be dangerous. This trial is testing a brand-new synthetically-constructed &#39;fake&#39; gene that is &#39;most similar to one found in a cow&#39;. This is a concerning use of synthetic genes and of animal genes in plants.

It&#39;s not wanted. Even America has abandoned attempts to commercialise GM wheat because there is no market for it. Biotech company BASF recently backed out of Europe because no-one wanted to buy GM food.

Once it flowers, it&#39;s here to stay. The trial is happening in the open air, meaning that it can cross-contaminate other wheat crops and wild grasses. This is a real threat. In Canada there is no organic oilseed rape left because all the farms have been cross-contaminated with GM rape.
