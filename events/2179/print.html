		<td>Following on from the project LaDIYfest ran during June, a discussion and workshop about issues raised and thoughts to carry forward about encouraging you to grow your body hair. Includes putting together pages to be collated into a zine that LaDIYfest will produce and distribute at future events. SO come along with all your creative ideas including any pictures or poems or pieces of writing or diaries or illustrations you have put together – these should be on an a4 page and nice and clear to be photocopied into black and white. 

All are welcome to the workshop, please note this event will be run in line with LaDIYfest Sheffields ‘Safe Spaces‘ policy, so please take a minute to read this.
