		<td>Violence against women doesn&#39;t just affect women, it affects the men in their lives too, men can and do feel the effects of other men&#39;s violence towards the women they care about. The White Ribbon Campaign focuses on men working to end violence against women. Most men are not violent towards women, but many may ignore the problem, seeing it as something which doesn&#39;t have anything to do with them. This is not true, and more men are needed to show their support in tackling men&#39;s violence against women. Speak out against it. Violence towards women is not natural, normal or inevitable - not all men do it, so we need to send out a message that there is help and treatment out there to change men&#39;s violent behaviour.

Join in this 6-a-side football tournament and show your support for ending violence towards women. The money raised from this event will go towards several sexual and domestic abuse organisations in Sheffield such as the Janus Project, which works with domestic abusers in order to address and change their behaviour, and the Rape Crisis Centre, which supports women who have experienced rape and sexual assault. 

There will be hot food and snacks at a small charge (all proceeds to charity), drinks and entertainment available on the day too. Children welcome. Fully licensed bar (under 18s permitted if accompanied). Raffle with some great prizes donated by local Sheffield companies.
