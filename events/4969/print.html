		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Our money system is broken. Positive Money, a movement for a fair, democratic and sustainable money system, has detailed proposals to fix this.

* What are these proposals? 
* What has been achieved already?
* What does the London-based team do?
* What leading figures/media/organisations has it already reached and impacted? 
* Where do we see things heading?

Insider Graham Hodgson has carried out significant work as a volunteer with the Positive Money team, and is well placed to fill us in on the story of this movement’s operation, ethos and mushrooming influence.

Free event, but they ask for a voluntary contribution of up to £5, depending on ability to pay.
