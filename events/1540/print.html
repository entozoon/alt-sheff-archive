		<td>The IWW (International Workers of the World) is a radical, grassroots union that can trace its history back to 1905, and has a membership all over the globe, from Chicago to Paris to Tyneside. As well as being a union in its own right, it also welcomes those who are members of other unions and has a long productive history of dual card membership, allowing trade unionists to connect with others, across the labour movement.

At this meeting the aim is to discuss the direction that the branch should take, the best way it can support its members and the skills that all have to share. This meeting will bring together experienced trade unionists and those just starting out in the labour movement who may just need help at work. They will also be looking to elect branch officers, so please come, have your say and get involved, it's a membership run and directed union which needs your opinion. Even if you're just interested in coming down and listening in, you are more than welcome.
