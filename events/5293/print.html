		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A 6.5 km cycle ride and street festival with music, food, drink, giveaways and activities. Free to enter, for anyone on a bike (includes electric cycles, and bikes to hire). All run by British Cycling, which trains cycling volunteers to "to lead and inspire rides". They´re closing the roads to traffic (in 14 cities across Britain!) so: NO CARS! Sponsored by the Council and various organisations including HSBC, who have done so much for investors in the fossil fuel industry, money laundering, tax evasion ... but who could be cynical about bike riding? They want "every child to experience the freedom of whizzing through their city on a bike and exploring" so it’s all good. 

Registering in advance gets you details of the route when it’s released (not online, a week before, without registration). You also get things like a free Let’s Ride bib, bike check-up, and chance of 10% off a Let´s Ride jersey (advertising HSBC, front and back). Note the conditions say that cycles must be roadworthy, helmets are compulsory for under-18s, and recommended but not compulsory for adults. Children 5 to 15 years must be registered and accompanied by a parent or guardian (or prior written consent of), under 5s must be secured in a BS standard child seat or trailer. The organisers, sponsors or promoters may take photographs or videos of the ride for publicity purposes. No pets are permitted. Apart from that, everyone’s invited.
