		<th>Details</th>
		<td>It seems that the climate emergency has fallen off the political agenda. Discussion of this, with introductory talks by Michael Bayley, over two evenings (23rd and 30th). The first evening is to look for signs of hope without being na√Øve or unrealistic. The second evening will look deeper and address such questions as: Why is our society so hooked on ever increasing consumption? What can be done to cure this addiction? What role can faith groups and other groups with a commitment to respecting the planet play in this?

Sessions begin at 7.30pm, preceded by tea and biscuits from 7pm.</td>
