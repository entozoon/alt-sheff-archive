		<td>Exhibition of work on social eating and design, accompanying The National Food Service Symposium. Work by various people including Marsha Smith, Megan Blake, Kata Fodor, Kenneth Okafor and Nick Taylor Buck.

The National Food Service Symposium is the first of its kind on the emerging non-hierarchical, non-charity, open source social eating movement. It aims to foster a collective knowledge base at a time of significant social innovation among problems of food poverty, social isolation and exclusion, and food waste. Imagine a future with free eating spaces on every street. The Foodhall Project Sheffield examines this utopian vision, with a series of free talks and meals.

Free to attend, part of the 2018 Festival of the Mind.
