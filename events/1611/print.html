		<td>Rotherham Federation of Tenants and Residents (RotherFed) is running a 5 week campaigning and influencing course to help people  run successful campaigns that can make a difference in their community.  The course is friendly and informal and open to all, facilitated by Steve Ruffle. All the sessions are held between 2pm and 4pm on Wednesday afternoons at Springwell Gardens Community Centre. People can attend all five sessions or just the ones they are interested in.  The sessions are free of charge and are open to all but places need to be booked. Certificate available to attendees of the  full course. 

The first session  Planning your Campaign, will be held on Wednesday 5th October 2011 using a fictitious campaign to ‘Free Dave’ we will look at the details of planning your campaign so it is effective and you can have some success.  The second session is on Wednesday 12th October 2011 and will include a Panel Discussion on Campaigning, Influencing and Democracy. Hopefully this will be a lively afternoon with questions, answers and real debate and discussion.  On Wednesday 19th October the session is entitled Putting Together and Taking Forward Resolutions.  We will help  put together effectively worded resolutions to your group meetings. This  session will also provide an opportunity for members to draft resolutions for the RotherFed delegates meeting in November 2011. 

The session Using the World Wide Web as a Tool on Wednesday 26th October 2011 will look at the role of social networking and how we can effectively use the internet as a campaigning tool. The final session Public Speaking on Wednesday 2nd November 2011 will  examine some of the skills needed to prepare and deliver speeches in public and help those who wish to present resolutions to our delegates meeting, plan and practice their speeches.
