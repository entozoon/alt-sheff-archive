Few people ask the question “where does money come from?”. The surprising answer is that 97% of money is created by banks when they make loans. This talk will illustrate how the nation has surrendered its sovereign right to create money to private banks, and how this leads to high levels of private debt, and a transfer of money from the poor to the rich.

Positive Money ask for a donation (suggested £3) to cover costs. Positive Money is a campaign to create a money and banking system that works for society and not against it. Meetings on the last Monday in each month, except public holidays. Local events, screenings, presentations, talks and discussions with the aim of spreading the word and helping the campaign grow. Meetings also provide an open and inclusive space for supporters to meet like-minded people in a friendly environment and to debate the questions around the money system.
