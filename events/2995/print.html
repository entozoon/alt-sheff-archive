		<td>Peaceful gathering to celebrate and defend multicultural Sheffield, supported by Sheffield Unite Against Fascism and One Sheffield Many Cultures. Please encourage any trade union, faith or community group you are a member of to pledge their support and to strongly oppose plans by the violent English Defence League (EDL) to hold a racist demonstration in north Sheffield on Saturday 21 September, a cynical and self serving attempt by the EDL to use racism to divide our multicultural city without a care for the damage they leave in their wake. 

The EDL is a racist group dedicated to attacking Asian people and Muslims. Islamophobia - bigotry against Muslims - is as unacceptable as any other form of racism. Its aim is to divide us by making scapegoats of one community. Today they threaten Muslims, tomorrow it could be Jewish people, Hindus, Sikhs, black people, lesbians and gay men, Travellers or Eastern Europeans. The EDL has also targeted trade unionists. In June, thousands of Sheffield people joined the One Sheffield Many Cultures gathering to oppose the EDL in its cynical attempt to exploit the horrific death of soldier Lee Rigby against the wishes of his family. Attending these peaceful multicultural celebrations shows that the overwhelming majority of Sheffield people reject the violence, racism and division of the EDL.
