		<td>Victor Rodríguez Nunez and Alan Yates  

Víctor Rodríguez Núñez, poet, journalist, critic, translator and academic, is one of Cuba’s most noteworthy contemporary writers. Author of eighteen collections of poetry, many of which have appeared in translation, and recipient of many literary awards and prizes, he is also an accomplished translator. He will be reading from his work including the rich and sensuous collections Thaw and The Infinite’s Ash and the work will be translated so you can enjoy the words in two languages. 

Alan Yates is emeritus professor of Catalan at Sheffield University and the translator of Els sots feréstecs/Dark Vales (1901), a remarkable piece of fiction published in fin-de siècle Catalonia. Alan will talk about the translation process and challenges of capturing the style and mood of the novelist for a contemporary English reader.
