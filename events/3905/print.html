		<td>Should the private rented sector be regulated? Are we a generation of renters? What is the answer to high rents and poor accommodation? Political parties ahead of the election have made a number of promises to renters and first-time buyers. Dothey go far enough or is regulation too much? In association with Student Voices.

The Festival of Debate is taking place in Sheffield in the run-up to the General election, during March and April. It provides opportunities to get together and discuss a range of issues which affect everyone. Informed decision making and strategic planning are essential for democracy, so come and get involved. They also welcome volunteers, from attending events and taking part in discussions to volunteering time to help run an event, promote the festival and much more. Unless otherwise stated events are free to attend, but if possible please register via the appropriate Eventbrite link on the Festival of Debate website below to give organsisers an idea of numbers.
