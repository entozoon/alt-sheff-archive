		<td>The Government recently announced Â£7 million funding for cycling development around the National Park and the Tour de France is coming to Yorkshire and the Peak District next year. So, 2013 is a great time for the first ever Peak District Cycling Festival, with 60+ rides for all ages and abilities and activities over 9 days.

Events range from guided mountain bike rides and relaxed evening routes through to bike orienteering, women-only rides and more challenging road outings, even a residential weekend with cycling activities and evening entertainment. You can also attend as a day visitor. Some events require pre-booking, so see the details on the websites below.
