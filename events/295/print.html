		<td>The <i>Gaza Freedom March</i> of 1,300 people plans to be in Gaza by 31st December, for a non-violent march alongside thousands of Gazan Palestinians to call for the end to the illegal blockade. See <a href="http://www.gazafreedommarch.org/">www.gazafreedommarch.org</a>

Meanwhile the <i>Viva Palestina</i> convoy of over 200 vehicles and 400 people left the UK in early December and should reach Gaza any day now. See <a href="http://www.vivapalestina.org/">www.vivapalestina.org</a>

Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign asks that you please follow the progress of both these international movements, call on the BBC and other media to report on them and be ready to respond to calls for protest if either the convoy or the freedom march are prevented from entering Gaza.
