		<td>It’s been almost a decade since the press complaints commission issued guidance to address what it agreed was widespread inaccurate reporting on the issue of asylum, yet the media still fuels negativity and a one sided view. To Walk In Your Shoes is a documentary exploration that represents the side without a voice. 

2pm and 4pm To Walk in Your Shoes (excerpts), by Red Bobble Theatre: What if you had an hour to flee your country?

 Exhibition by Rachael Munro-Fawcett, continues daily  10.30am– 6pm, until Friday.

Part of <a href="http://refugeeweek.org.uk/">Refugee Week</a>, celebrating sanctuary in Sheffield, which was the UK’s first City of Sanctuary. A partnership between Theatre Delicatessen and University of Sheffield supported by Arts Council England. All events are "Pay What You Decide". Migration Matters Festival continues through to 25th June 2016.
