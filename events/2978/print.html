		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (SFNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. This month: Poetry

This ride is a complementary off-beat contribution from SFNR to the Off the Shelf Festival and the International Poetry Festival 2014. It could start at the statue of Ebenezer Elliott, the Corn Law Rhymer, in Weston Park or at the Byron House or at The Shakespeare and ride to places with poems, and places like Wordsworth Avenue.
