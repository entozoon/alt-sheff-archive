		<td>Permaculture is a chance to look at the world in a creative, positive, co-operative and solutions-based approach. Gardens, communities, businesses; its ideas and insights can be applied in many contexts. It is a bottom-up, nature-first development approach focusing on the relocalisation of food and resource production, reduction of waste and investment in the abundance nature offers.

This local and social opportunity for learning about creating sustainability is with a new permaculture teacher, Dave Thomas.

The basic principles of permaculture and observing how it affects our environment. There will be time to discuss, play, explore and share knowledge. Fantastic venue (<a href="http://www.diggersanddreamers.org.uk/index.php?one=pnm&amp;two=det&amp;sel=oakleigh">Oakleigh Housing Co-op</a>) with a cosy room and a big garden to play in. 

Saturday: 9:30-5pm plus social evening (an exploration of permaculture in our culture, bring an instrument if you play, your voice if you sing and your legs if you dance!). Sunday: 9:30-6pm. Lunch and also dinner on the Saturday evening together, please bring food to share. Limited places available, filling up fast. To book onto the course, and for directions, please contact <a href="mailto:graaaaaaavy@gmail.com">graaaaaaavy@gmail.com</a> (This is NOT a spelling mistake!)</td>
