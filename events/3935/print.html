		<td>97% of our money supply is created by banks and loaned to us at interest. But what is money anyway? How does our money system cause inequality and can we ever escape our dependence on debt? Hosted by Peter Verity, co-ordinator of the Sheffield group of Positive Money supporters. Positive Money is a campaign to democratise money and banking so that it works for society and not against it.
