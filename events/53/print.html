		<td>Sheffield FridayNightRides are a bit of fun, open to anyone who can get hold of a bike. This one has on the theme of Hidden Hillsborough. It will be a ride out to Hillsborough then up to Birley Stone, Oughtibridge, Worral, Loxley Edge then back through Loxley, Hillsborough and on to the Kelham Island Tavern. A couple of tough slopes but you can walk if its too tough or pedal all the way - and of course there are some lovely slopes to go down as well. About 13 miles.
