		<td>Castlegate Festival is a two-day celebration of the oldest part of the city of Sheffield, to highlight the area’s historical importance and to provide inspiration for its future. Events include the work of artists who form part of the community in Castlegate, and students from the School of Architecture at the University of Sheffield.

There are three main festival venues and other events taking place around Castlegate. <ul><li>Castle House (the old Co-op department store) Angel Street S3 8LN</li><li>Exchange Place Studios</li><li>Bank Street Arts</li></ul>A few highlights:

Streetfilms; short films to show how smart transportation design and policy can result in better places to live, work and play. What lessons can Sheffield learn from other world cities which are embracing public spaces, living streets and alternatives to the car?

The Festival Bar at Bank Street Arts, with drinks and food in their relaxing Georgian Courtyard. On the Saturday, catch an eclectic mix of live world music and poetry from visiting stars celebrating Refugee Week including Zimbabwe’s Stella Chiweshe, Sarah Yaseen and Tangled Roots performance poets.

The festival will culminate in a fun Street Party and everyone is invited! Buskers and street acts will be bringing Castlegate to life.
