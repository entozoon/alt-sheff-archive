		<td>In the wake of the EU referendum it is clear that we have a democratic deficit in the UK - that a range of different voices with a host of genuine concerns are not being heard or enabled to speak to power effectively. The Festival of Debate Our Democracy Hub Day explores some of these unheard voices - as well as the mechanisms by which those voices are able to engage in the democratic process - through a series of concurrent workshops and panel discussions. Suggested donation for daytime events £5

1.30-2.15pm <strong>Workshop: What Does 21st Century Workplace Democracy Look Like?</strong> Sheffield TUC explore workplace democracy, the role of unions and legislation in aiding workers. How much of a voice can workers exercise in contemporary employment, which is often characterised by low pay and insecure work?

1.30-2.15pm <strong>Workshop: Disability and Democracy in Healthcare.</strong> The government says it wants to create a society where disabled people can realise their aspirations and potential. This workshop from Healthwatch Sheffield and Disability Sheffield will explore the reality – the issues, challenges and opportunities - with people who are taking action.

1.30-2.15pm <strong>Workshop: Black History Month for Dummies, White Teachers & Everybody Else.</strong> In a multicultural population, why are educators not teaching a more multicultural curriculum? Melissa Simmonds, parent and founder of MisTÂûght, believes that Black History benefits all children. Hear her story of helping her child’s school make Black History more personal to the communities around them.

2.30-3.15pm <strong>Workshop: A ‘Free Press’ is a Cornerstone of Democracy, but how can it be free if it isn’t available to all?</strong> ‘Don’t hate the media, become the media,’ said Jello Biafra. A workshop from Burngreave Messenger, exploring how to use written media to promote your campaign, creating engaging content for hyperlocal, social and mainstream media.

2.30-3.15pm <strong>Workshop: Direct Action Gets The Goods. How to take on your landlord and win.</strong> Join ACORN Sheffield for a short workshop and Q&A on the union’s highly effective, sometimes controversial, use of direct action against landlords and letting agents.

2.30-3.15pm <strong>Workshop: Transport Poverty.</strong> Cycling currently accounts for just 2% of measured trips. Under 30% of households in Sheffield City Region don’t have a car, but with public transport changing routes and raising fares, many are in ‘transport poverty’. Join Cycle Sheffield to debate how to enable the majority to travel across Sheffield sustainably.

3.30-4.45pm <strong>Workshop: Rebooting Politics.</strong> From health to housing, why is the government failing to tackle societal challenges? Unlock Democracy host this workshop exploring how to shake up stale politics, get big ideas heard and push for radical change - with a focus on action.

3.30-4.45pm <strong>Talk: The Gender Pay Gap, One Year On.</strong> The Women’s Equality Party discuss the gender pay gap. What can be done for women from all backgrounds to achieve parity with men? What challenges lie ahead after regulations in April 2018 requiring companies to reveal differentials in pay?

5-6.45pm <strong>Panel: Radical Neighbourhoods. How is Local Democracy Changing?</strong> New forms of local neighbourhood democracy are emerging. From active citizens coming together on campaigns, to newly devolved forms of local authority. Featuring Jim Steinke (Sheffield City Council Cabinet Member for Neighbourhoods), Nigel Slack (Active Citizen), Ruth Hubbard (It’s Our City) & Kate Faulkes (Head of Stronger Communities in Barnsley Council). Chaired by Maddy Desforges (Voluntary Action Sheffield).

This event will be followed by a screening of the acclaimed documentary Brexitannia and a Q&A with director Timothy George Kelly (tickets sold separately).
