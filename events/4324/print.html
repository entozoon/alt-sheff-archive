		<td>A discussion course looking at social, environmental, political and ethical issues, UK and world-wide. <strong>This is session 2 of a course which runs on Thursdays 10.30am - 12.30pm, for 11 weeks from 7th January 2016. Last meeting March 17th, with no break at half-term. </strong>

Courses need a minimum number of 12 participants in order to run and have an upper limit of 16 for this course. So if you cannot get to the first week, please contact tutor (Paul Boizot) first to say that you intend to come later, and if you only find out about a course after week 1, contact tutor to find out if there is a place for you, in case the course is either full or cancelled. The best way to guarantee a place is to enrol in advance online or by phone. Online and phone enrolments are limited to 14, leaving just 2 places for people to enrol "on the day" so advance booking is recommended.

A Workers Educational Association (WEA) course. Enrol for term: fees for 11 weeks £71.50, or FREE if you are on means-tested state benefits, or Working Tax Credit with income under £15,276. Enrol online at <a href="http://www.wea.org.uk/yh">www.wea.org.uk/yh</a> or phone WEA Regional Office 0113 2453304.
