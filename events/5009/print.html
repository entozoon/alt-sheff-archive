		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A bi-annual vegan festival in a nearby city, well worth a day out. The biggest vegan festival in Yorkshire, no less. Event partnered with Viva! and ´First Direct´ Arena to show that veganism is healthy, affordable and fun. Live music and entertainment, lots of lovely like-minded people, and vegan treats from international dishes to convenience foods, nutritional guidance, recipes, helpful factsheets, cookery demos and plenty of information stalls and talks. Vegan stuff from bags to chocolate, clothes to activism. 

All proceeds go to animal welfare charities such as Miracle’s Mission. Festival run by Viva! and sponsored by various companies, but run entirely by volunteers; if you want to help out get in touch. Standard entry £5, under 14´s free.
