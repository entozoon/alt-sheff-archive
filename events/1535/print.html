		<td>The Children’s Society in South Yorkshire, Embrace Programme, is hosting the photographic exhibition as part of June's Gypsy Roma Traveller History Month. In the modern world, when reality is not recorded it does not exist. This exhibition is a photographic documentation of a group of young Roma women living in London. It is an essential record of their everyday lives, challenging common stereotypes and assumptions.

Who are the Roma? The term Roma refers to various groups of people who describe themselves as Roma, Manouches, Ashkali, Sinti, and other titles. They originated in the Indian subcontinent, migrating towards Europe over 1,000 years ago and now form the biggest ethnic minority in the European Union.

The work in this exhibition has developed from collaboration between a group of young teenage Roma women, led by photographer Manuela Zanotti and The Children’s Society. Previous representations of Roma people show them as either romantic and free or living in desperate poverty. The large format and digital images taken by the group break from these stereotypes. The young women document a crucial moment in their lives as they undergo many complex transitions: from girlhood into womanhood, from Eastern European segregation to attempted British multiculturalism and from passive outsiders to active participants in society.</td>
