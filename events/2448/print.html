		<td>One Sheffield Many Cultures public seminar. Join Butch Fazal (National Asians in Football Forum), Brendan Ingle and other contributors for a wide ranging discussion.

The Olympics showed how sport can play its part in challenging the barriers of racism, sexism and disability. But how much did the multicultural heartbeat of the Olympics mark a turning point in the relationship between sport and racism? Can sport be a vehicle to challenge racism or does sport itself perpetuate obstacles to progress? The panel will briefly share their experiences before opening up the discussion.

Brendan Ingle came to Sheffield from Ireland and set up his boxing gym in Wincobank in the 1960′s. He has become a Sheffield icon, training champions and hundreds of young people from many different communities. His gym is a living example of the multicultural society in action – where talent is all that counts, not the colour of your skin.

Butch Fazal, Chair of the National Asians in Football Forum and member of the national Race Equality Advisory Group, has been an advocate of equality issues for a number of years. He is the co-founder of Luton United Football Club – the biggest BME youth football club in Bedfordshire – and also the Black and Asian Coaches’ Association (BACA).

Refreshments from 6pm, for a 6:30pm start.
