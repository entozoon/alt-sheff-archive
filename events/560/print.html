		<td>On horse racing awareness week, Sheffield Animal Friends will be spreading the word about the cruelty involved in this "sport". Approximately 18,000 foals are born into the closely-related British and Irish racing industries each year, yet only around 40% go on to become racers. Those horses who do not make the grade may be slaughtered for meat or repeatedly change hands in a downward spiral of neglect. Of those horses who do go on to race, around 420 are raced to death every year.
