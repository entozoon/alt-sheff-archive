		<td>All of the public, including ACORN members and supporters are requested to come along to this event, related to the Bus Review Consultation of "Sheffield City Region". It is a drop-in session with the commissioners, organised by Cllr. Paul Turpin. 

After the consultation meeting ACORN will be taking their petition to nearby bus stops to talk to members of the public, about the argument that public control is the only solution to the disastrous privatised bus system in South Yorkshire. ACORN Sheffield is fighting for bus franchising which would give the people the power to set fares, routes, and ticketing. It could stop bus companies putting the desire for profit above public needs. 

<strong>The petition can also be signed online <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/sheffield-bus-campaign">here</a>, along with full details of what ACORN are saying about our public transport</strong>. You can sign up for a space at the consultation at the link below.
