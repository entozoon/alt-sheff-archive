		<td>March to reclaim the night from both the fear and reality of gender-based violence. Make sure to bring placards, chants and winter woolies! It is followed  by a rally at 7.30pm at Fusion, Sheffield Students’ Union, Western Bank. If you can’t make it to the march, you are still very welcome to attend the rally which is open to all genders. It will include performances from Poetry Society, musical entertainment, and speakers Nell Stockton (LGBT Rights Activist) and Michelle Webster (Sheffield Rape and Sexual Abuse Counselling Service), a zine library and tables for craftivism, cakes, tea and coffee. Collection raising money for charities Ashiana and Sheffield Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre.

Reclaim the Night marches started in the 1970s, when the Yorkshire Ripper was murdering women in and around Leeds and police told women not to go out at night. Women were angry at this attempt to restrict their freedom and responded by taking to the streets. Today, people are still subject to harassment and oppression because of their gender identity or expression.

The march is open to self-identifying women and people who experience discrimination or oppression based on their gender identity, and to carers, personal assistants and dependents of all genders. Full details at link below.
