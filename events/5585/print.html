		<td>In the face of overwhelming scientific evidence of man-made climate change, how do we take action to significantly reduce our impact on the world? The challenge can seem too big, too daunting, and while knowledge and understanding are important, just as important is a belief that we can change things for the better. This event explores many related topics through a range of short concurrent sessions. 

Among the speakers is Frack Free South Yorkshire founder and science teacher, David Burley. He will be discussing the topic, ´How do you beat a government hell-bent on fracking?´ at 1.30pm

Stalls by Sheffield Climate Alliance, Sheffield Against Fracking, Friends of the Earth and more.
