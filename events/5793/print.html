		<td>Pre-election, Extinction Rebellion Sheffield will stage a day of flooding-themed events at a secret location in Sheffield city centre as part of the national ‘12 Days of Crisis’ campaign to address the ecological crisis upon us, the mass species extinctions and runaway climate change. Societal collapse and mass deaths cannot be ignored by criminal government inactivity. Extinction Rebellion believes it is a citizen’s duty to rebel, using peaceful civil disobedience.

Activities include:
 <strong>
Democratic people’s assembly 
"<i>Disco</i>bedience" 
Rebels dressed for severe weather and flooding
Crisis carol singing
Flooding-themed visuals
Closing ceremony around 4pm
</strong>
