		<td>Will the next financial crisis be handled with more of the same - austerity and bailouts? Or are there alternative and better options?

Graham Hodgson of Sheffield Positive Money Supporters Group will outline the orthodox justification for austerity and present two progressive alternatives: MMT&#39;s Job Guarantee Scheme and Positive Money&#39;s QE For People, and explain the reasoning behind them.

The event is free but a voluntary donation of up to Â£5 to cover costs would be appreciated.</td>
