		<td>A documentary about sports legend Lance Armstrong’s improbable rise and ultimate fall from grace. In 2009 Alex Gibney was hired to make a film about Lance Armstrong’s comeback to cycling. The project was shelved when the doping scandal erupted, and re-opened after Armstrong’s confession. This film picks up in 2013 and presents a riveting, insider’s view of the unravelling of one of the most extraordinary stories in the history of sports. As Lance Armstrong himself says: “I didn’t live a lot of lies, but I lived one big one.”

Tickets: £6 without coffee/tea/cake (or £8 with coffee/tea/cake)
