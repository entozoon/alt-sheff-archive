		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. Talks are typically about a common belief that can be demonstrated to be false or cannot be justified by the available evidence.

This month's presentation is about the "Angels of Mons" and other wartime legends and apparently supernatural forces intervening in wars. Speaker David Clarke (PhD in English Cultural Tradition and Folklore), is the author of a book on the subject, and a senior lecturer in journalism at Sheffield Hallam University.

The events are free though they ask for a Â£2 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
