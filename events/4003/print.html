Positive Money is a pressure group campaigning against the unaccountable power of banks to create money. If we want to deal with the big social, economic and environmental challenges that weâ€™re facing today, we must start by fixing the monetary supply system. The problems of the current system have led to the looming debt crisis which is engulfing Britain and much of the world. 

Two speakers from the organisations explain the problems with our current monetary system and how it can be reformed. The format will be a 30 min talk followed by questions.

Public event, free entry</td>
