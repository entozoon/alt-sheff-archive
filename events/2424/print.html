		<th>Details</th>
		<td>As part of Palestine Culture Week, Gaza-born Palestinian author Musheir El-Farra launches his book, described as a moving and careful account of the effects of the Israeli treatment of the people of Gaza. The stories are of families, in their own words, who have lost children, relatives, land and property, by deliberate Israeli attacks on civilians. It is a human story, told with deep integrity by a son of Gaza, a story that cries out for justice. All who think there is a case to defend Israeli actions should read it.

A discussion will be chaired by Claire Short (Secretary of State for International Development in the Blair Government, who resigned over Iraq)
