		<td>Positive Money is a campaign to democratise money and banking so that it works for society and not against it. The Sheffield group of Positive Money supporters meet the last Monday each month, at the Quaker Meeting House. If you think our money and banking system is broken, please join them!

The campaign has grown in strength and numbers over the last year. Dora Meade, network coordinator from Positive Money UK, will attend this January meeting to talk about the campaign, the network, and to look ahead to 2015. She will give information about recent developments in the campaign and news from across the network, as well as leading a discussion about plans for the coming year - both for the Sheffield local group and the organisation as a whole. This will include details of opportunities, tools and resources that will be made available for Positive Money supporters over the coming year.

This is an opportunity to feed in your ideas, discuss the campaign and think practically about what you would like to see the Sheffield local group dedicating time to in the coming year. Everyone welcome.
