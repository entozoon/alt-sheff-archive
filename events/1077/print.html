Sheffield Animal Friends have done a couple of these now, and they're a great way to promote veganism to the general public. Theyâ€™ll need lots of help to make this one even better, so if you're vegan and live near enough to come and lend a hand you'd be very welcome! Please do get in touch at <a href="mailto:sheffieldanimalfriends@gmail.com">sheffieldanimalfriends@gmail.com</a> to find out how you can help.
