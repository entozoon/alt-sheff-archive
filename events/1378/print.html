		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A public meeting following the successful Save Reza Yosefi campaign. Reza, who grew up in Iran and has been a refugee all his life, was facing deportation to Afghanistan on a Government Charter Flight. He is now being released from Colnbrook detention centre after a high profile campaign helped stop his deportation. But many Afghani asylum seekers in Sheffield are living in fear of detention and deportation. This is also true for asylum seekers from other war-torn regions like Iraq and DR Congo that are also unsafe. 

Until a few weeks ago the UK Borders Agency told Libyan migrants in the UK to 'leave as soon as possible' when their visas expired!

The meeting will hear from asylum seekers and gather evidence about what the Government policy of deportations - to meet quotas for return of asylum seekers by country - really means. It will bring this evidence to the attention of the public, the media and politicians. It will consider ways to fight for a change to Government policy.

Organised by Sheffield Committee to Defend Asylum Seekers <a href="http://www.sheffieldcdas.org.uk/">www.sheffieldcdas.org.uk</a></td>
