		<th>Details</th>
		<td>On the eve of the general election, Britain stands divided; hypocrisies spiral as each side paints the others in broad, cartoonish, ugly strokes. Whilst our world recedes into isolationism, four theatre-makers try to respond to this tumultuous moment in politics with humour, fury and hope. This event is a chance to see new work in development from the companies involved and a free space for artists to test their ideas out on new audiences. 

Pay as you feel. All money raised will go directly to the participating artists. Please reserve your seat for free. Part of Festival of Debate.
