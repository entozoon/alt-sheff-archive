		<td>Sheffield Save Our NHS Public Meeting, discussing new local plans for the NHS, privatisation and Brexit. Celebrate the NHS 68th anniversary with some birthday cake. Join the fight to support it.

What about the NHS after Brexit? The Westminster government and opposition are in a state of collapse. The NHS needs continuous public mobilisation if it is to be saved. Many "Leave" voters wanted to believe the pledges being made by the Leave campaign for the NHS, pledges which were called lies at the time, and which Leave leaders are now rowing back from.  But the NHS is already in crisis and management efforts have been pinned this year to Service and Transformation Plans which, in our case, will cover South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw.  In many areas these are being introduced to bring about major changes including service closures, and through decisions often made behind closed doors. 

So what does the immediate future hold for the NHS in South Yorkshire? Come and hear where the plans have got to so far. Does this mean more privatisation? Campaigners from other parts of the area invited, as the plans are likely to have significant effects on Barnsley, Rotherham, Doncaster and Chesterfield. 

Downstairs room at the United Reform Church at the corner of Chapel Walk and Norfolk Street. Meeting at 7pm, but cake will be available beforehand!</td>
