		<td>Sure Start Centres all over the country are under threat of closure and budget cuts. In Sheffield the Council may cut funding to all Sure Starts by 15% when they set the new budget on 4th March, leading to a dramatic service reductions. If you'd like to attend any events or help resist the cuts to Sure Start in any way you can please get in touch.

Sure Start Centres provide an invaluable service to our communities. They provide family support and outreach work where they visit families in their home. They provide breast feeding support, English language classes, stay and play groups, Dad's groups, healthy eating and baby weaning workshops, etc. Most importantly they provide a space for families to come together as part of a community and take a holistic approach to supporting families with young children.
