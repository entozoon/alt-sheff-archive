		<td>Heeley City Farm’s annual Autumn Show is back for its 31st year! Enter the produce show – do you have the biggest onion or even the most slug riddled lettuce? Then grab an entry form and see if you can win a certificate!

Entertainment, craft, food and gift stalls, a veg monsters competition, animal petting in the Small Animal House, raffle, tombola, grass head character making, Human Fruit Machine down in the Energy Centre, rodeo bull and bouncy slide, sheep racing, face painting, henna art, special offers in the Garden Centre and fantastic, tasty food on sale in The Farm Kitchen including a stall selling Alison’s famous home made cakes.

FREE admission to the main event; a tiny charge for entry into the produce show. All produce is auctioned off at the end of the day, unless reserved, to raise money for the farm.

Entries for the Produce Show must be in by 11am – forms are available from the Garden Centre, main office, Farm Kitchen and at food growing sites in Meersbrook Walled Garden, Wortley Hall, Norfolk Park and Firth Park Community Allotment, also on the Facebook page and shortly on the website.
