		<td>A night of punk, acoustic and spoken word, along with vegan pizza and cake to raise much needed funds for the awesome Doris Banham Dog Rescue. 

This charity works tirelessly to save abandoned dogs awaiting death at council pounds each day in the UK. Dogs that are picked up by the pound only have to be kept there for seven days before they can be euthanised. Doris Banham Dog Rescue saves and rehomes hundreds of death row dogs in the UK each year. DBDR is run entirely by volunteers who put their time, energy and resources into saving lives each day. 

Bands include: Throw Rocks At Cops, Kworyl, Howl + more to be confirmed. 

Â£3 suggested donation for entry, raffle with loads of great prizes plus Sheffield finest vegan pizza and cake. 

Come and help raise funds for the Doris Banham dogs!
