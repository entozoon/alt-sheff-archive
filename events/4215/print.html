		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. 

This month it is "Civic Heritage" to celebrate the Heritage Open Days in Sheffield and across the country. You get a chance to visit buildings and sites that are not regularly or frequently open to the public, or a special event may be put on for the general public. Sheffield Civic Trust organises and coordinates the events and openings in Sheffield. The map of all the places open is <a href="http://sheffieldcivictrust.org.uk/hod_map/map.php">here.</a>

This ride will go past many of the places open in town and up into Crookes and Walkley, to return via the Lower Don Valley. At the Art Nouveau Walkley Community Centre there should be a guided tour. The start and finish point, The Sheffield Tap, will be badging one of its beers for the weekend and putting on a talk at 3pm on Sunday 13 Sep about the work and thought behind the refurbishment of the old waiting and dining rooms as the pub and brewery. 

Use tough tyres and a spare inner tube, bring lights and locks.
