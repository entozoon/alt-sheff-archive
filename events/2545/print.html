		<td>SACA works to publicise the cuts and support the people of Sheffield to fight back and offer alternatives to the brutal "austerity" attacks on living standards and rights. 

The February meeting of SACA will cover an important item for discussion; how Labour Councils should be expected to respond to the cuts. SACA is discussing a clear position on recent developments. Labour councillors in Derby have recently joined a demonstration against the cuts, which is a step forward, but still voted for cuts. A campaign entitled <a href="http://afairdealforsheffield.com/">"Fair Deal for Sheffield"</a> has also been launched recently, which includes a petition against the cuts. Does this seek to spread the cuts around the UK more evenly rather than oppose the national austerity policy? The Labour Representation Committee has
recently launched <a href="http://councillorsagainstcuts.org/">Councillors against the Cuts</a> which goes further and does look at the practicalities of refusing to set a cuts budget. All welcome to come and join the discussion of which way this crucial protest should go.
