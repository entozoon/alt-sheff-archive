		<td>A talk open to the public, organised by the Sheffield Humanist Society, all welcome, introducing Mike Freedman, director of the documentary <a href="http://www.criticalmassfilm.com/">Critical Mass</a>. 

The world population is projected to rise from today's 6.8 billion to 9.15 billion in 2050. Mike Freedman will look at the converging environmental crises of the 21st century: population, economics, consumption, food production, water distribution and social behaviour

Global population growth is a key factor in environmental sustainability alongside consumption and technology but it is rarely if ever acknowledged; why is this? A look at the problems it causes and discussion of how through voluntary means such as improved reproductive healthcare, female empowerment, sex education and socio-economic development, a truly sustainable society can be achieved.

University Arms, 197 Brook Hill, Sheffield, S3 7HG is near Sheffield University tram stop, or by bus: 51 & 52 best; 94 & 95 close by.
