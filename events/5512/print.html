		<td>A illustrated talk by Musheir El-Farra, about his recent visit to the Gaza Strip, where a healing centre has been created with help from Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign, the Yemeni community, and many others.

The illegitimate Israeli siege is not breaking the resistance spirit among people despite the severe hardship they are experiencing. Musheir will report back on the progress of the childrens projects which Sheffield PSC supports, in partnership with local Palestinian grass root organisations, and how the injured of the Great March of Return are benefiting from the rehabilitation project. He will also talk about how Palestinians are responding to the solidarity work of supporters from Sheffield and beyond.
