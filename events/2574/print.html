		<td>Public meeting with short presentations about the reality of the cuts and changes to benefits. This will be followed by a choice of discussion in groups, planning for how to support those affected and how best to spread the word about the impacts of the cuts on the most vulnerable in society. 

Speakers:<ul><li> Frances Potter (Sheaf Citizens Advice Bureau). As the recession hit in 2009 Frances noted that “even though times were always hard, there was a strong belief in progress; but now for some people these beliefs are fading”. Four years on she reflects on how local people are reacting to cuts on Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit, DLA and other social support. </li><li>Dr Simon Duffy (Centre for Welfare Reform) who noted in a recent report that the burden of the austerity measures fall on the most vulnerable, “As need and poverty increases, so does the intensity with which the cuts are targeted, the very opposite of fair”. Here he will speak on the impact of current welfare reforms and privatisation </li></ul>Informal chat, tea and biscuits from 6.30pm, presentations and discussion from 7pm. Hosted by Sheffield Equality Group, Unite Community Sheffield – Publicising and protesting against the cuts to social support Sheaf CAB – Information on the cuts to benefits and how to get help, UK Uncut – Linking the cuts to corporate tax dodging with direct action, and Sheffield Equality Group. Free but donations gratefully received. All welcome.
