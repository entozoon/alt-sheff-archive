		<td>Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. 

This month Chris French, Professor of Psychology and Head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit in the Psychology Department at Goldsmiths. In terms of the evolutionary cost-benefit analysis, our cognitive systems are optimised for biological survival, not for apprehending “Truth”. We are poor at recognising randomness and often see meaning and significance where there is none, like our predisposition towards supernatural and paranormal beliefs. Full details on the website.

Free entry; £3 donation requested. The meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
