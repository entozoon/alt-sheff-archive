		<td>The next meeting of the campaign for a 20 mile per hour speed limit. A lot has been happening across the country towards the "Total 20" concept and there is also a new administration to work with in Sheffield. In addition the last administration had already ear-marked some residential streets for a default 20mph.

Professor Danny Dorling from the University of Sheffield will be speaking at this event. Professor Dorling will give an update as to progress in Sheffield and provide feedback from the well attended conference in Warrington this week.
