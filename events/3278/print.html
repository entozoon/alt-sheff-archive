		<td>Green Homes Sheffield aims to give householders ideas and confidence on making their homes more energy efficient. A range of homes across the city will show features like insulation, draught-proofing, solar panels, heat pumps, energy-efficient windows and extensions, and different levels of carbon saving. They are now inviting interest from people who have made a good start on the path to a low carbon home, to consider opening their home to the public to enable others to learn from the energy-saving improvements made. Your story could help and inspire others to make changes themselves, and they hope you will enjoy sharing it.

The initiative is part of national network <a href="http://www.greenopenhomes.net/">www.greenopenhomes.net</a>

There are 4 events during April and May 2014, after these Practice Openings. 

If you are interested, why not get in touch? There will be trained volunteers, trusted local suppliers, and lots of information and support about how to prepare, make sure everything is set up safely, and ensure necessary insurance is in place. They also provide postcards so you can invite your neighbours, signs to help visitors find your home, information leaflets relevant to your home, and on your selected days, you show people round the energy improvements in your home and tell them your story. They may have questions about which companies and technologies you used, and what it was like before, during and after the changes. Everyone learns from the experience, and more people in Sheffield start saving energy at home!
