		<td>This meeting features the Sheffield launch of Yorkshire CND&#39;s new research report on Menwith Hill, the US spy base on the moors in North Yorkshire, presented by the author of the report Dr Steve Schofield. 

This is the first report of its kind that investigates the role of Menwith Hill since the European Parliament resolved that the electronic surveillance breached the European Convention of Human Rights in 2001. It sheds light on the work of the US base which is run by the National Security Agency (NSA) under an informal and secretive lease agreement with the UK Government. Important questions are raised within the report regarding the base&#39;s accountability to Parliament. The report covers Menwith Hill&#39;s strategic role as a regional intelligence base illegally collecting and analyzing information from satellites, phone tapping and the interception of internet traffic, and the role that Menwith Hill plays in information-led warfare for US military actions such as drone attacks. It examines claims made by the US authorities, repeated in Parliament, about the economic benefit of the base to the local community, and the hidden economic costs of the base and the degree to which these are subsidised by the UK taxpayer. 

More information on Menwith Hill can be found online at <a href="http://www.yorkshirecnd.org.uk/">www.yorkshirecnd.org.uk</a>

Sheffield Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament has an active campaigning presence in the city, concentrating on the militarization of university campuses, Scrap Trident Campaign and the Yorkshire connection with the US Missile Defence System at Fylingdales and Menwith Hill. It meets on the third Wednesday of each month, except August, newcomers are welcome.
