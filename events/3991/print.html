Repair Cafe is a regular workshop event hosted by Repair Sheffield. Bring along your broken household stuff and volunteer fixers will take a look at it and see if they can work their magic on it. Small electrical items, shoes, scales, toys, tools and wooden furniture are just some of the items that can be brought along, and that have been successfully fixed at previous cafes. Fixers will show you how to mend items and pass on valuable knowledge which will enable you to do repairs for yourself, or go in to a repair shop with enough know-how to feel confident of getting the job done properly. 

Held in the Community Room by the pond at Heeley City Farm. This event is free but they gratefully welcome donations if people are able. All fixers are volunteers and the project has no funding. For more information contact Sarah Hardy on Sheff 2580482 option 5, or email <a href="mailto:s.hardy@heeleyfarm.org.uk">s.hardy@heeleyfarm.org.uk</a>
