		<td>Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, about a common belief that can be demonstrated to be false or cannot be justified by the available evidence.

Building on recent scientific discoveries, Mark Lynas explains that there are nine planetary boundaries that humanity must not cross if Earth is to continue to support life and civilisation. Climate change is one, but others - like ocean acidification, nitrogen use and biodiversity loss - are less well known, though equally crucial. Lynas presents a radical manifesto for increased use of technologies such as genetic engineering and nuclear power, as part of a global effort to protect the biosphere. He challenges the current environmental movement as likely to hinder as much as help our vitally-needed effort to use science and technology to play God and save the planet. Mark Lynas is the author of The God Species: How the Planet Can Survive the Age of Humans
