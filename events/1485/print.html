		<td>The Sheffield group of Amnesty International is to mark the movement's 50th anniversary by having a birthday party. All welcome. There will be a bar and live music.

In its 50 years, Amnesty's achievements have included being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977 for its work on torture and successfully campaigning for an International Criminal Court. It has grown to be the world's largest human rights organisation. It provides a unique blend of local, national and international campaigning. Local groups like Sheffield Amnesty International have contributed to making Amnesty International an effective and successful movement, in fact Sheffield is one of the longest standing groups in the UK. The celebrations commemorate not only the international successes but also  local day to day consistent work on a diverse range of themes including Arms Control and Refugees, and with local specialists working on a range of countries across the world. 

Sheffield Amnesty have public monthly meetings but are also involved in a variety of events throughout the year. They are looking forward to making more links with other local organisations including religious bodies, trades Unions, organisations promoting sexual and gender rights and others concerned with various aspects of human rights.  
 
Amnesty's famous logo- a candle surrounded by barbed wire- was inspired by the Chinese proverb "It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness". Over the past 50 years Amnesty has strived to curse the darkness of human rights violations and we've seen the great impact that the organisation has had in that time.
