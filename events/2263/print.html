		<td>Showing of this powerful film exposing the involvement of UN peacekeepers in the sex trade during the Bosnian War in the 1990s. 

An American single mother, Bolkovac (played bt Academy Award winner Rachel Weisz), a seasoned cop, joined the UN peacekeeping force in Bosnia, after its brutal civil war, to investigate the sex trafficking of young women from Eastern Europe. She discovered that a number of UN peacekeepers were themselves playing a part in prostitution rings. She told her employers what was going on, and lost her job. After a two-year legal battle in England, a tribunal ruled that she was unfairly dismissed. This powerful film, based ion Bolkovac’s personal story, shows images of the rape, torture and exploitation of the women caught up in the sex trade, and the efforts to cover up her findings. But after the release of the information, Amnesty International produced a report, “Hopes Betrayed”, pointing to corruption as the basis of many of the problems....

Everybody welcome. Light refreshments from 6.30pm (50p.) Entrance free. Voluntary donations to defray costs welcome. There will be a follow-up discussion about the issues raised in the film on Thursday 15 November at 7.15 pm. at the Quaker Meeting House.

Organised by The Women’s International League For Peace & Freedom (Sheffield) and Amnesty International UK (Sheffield) For more information tel. Sheff. 2353127</td>
