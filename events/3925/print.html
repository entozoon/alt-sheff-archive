		<td>Civic Capitalism is a book by Professors Colin Hay and Tony Payne, co-directors of Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute (SPERI), published by Polity Press in March. This book launch will be introduced by Ed Cox, Director of the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) North, after which both Colin and Tony will highlight some of the themes of the book. Organised in association with SPERI.

The Festival of Debate is taking place in Sheffield in the run-up to the General election, during March and April. It provides opportunities to get together and discuss a range of issues which affect everyone. Informed decision making and strategic planning are essential for democracy, so come and get involved. They also welcome volunteers, from attending events and taking part in discussions to volunteering time to help run an event, promote the festival and much more. Unless otherwise stated events are free to attend, but if possible please register via the appropriate Eventbrite link on the Festival of Debate website below to give organisers an idea of numbers.
