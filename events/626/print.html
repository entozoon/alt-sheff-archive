Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. Talks are typically about a common belief that can be demonstrated to be false or cannot be justified by the available evidence.

This month Simon Perry talks about his campaigns which have helped shut down dodgy allergy test services, prevented traditional Chinese medicine salesmen from claiming to cure cancer and exposed psychic scams. Simon will be explaining what works and what doesn't and some of the crazy nonsense he's encountered along the way.
