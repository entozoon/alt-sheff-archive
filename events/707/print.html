		<td>Innovative art and community project which involves students and people from the city working together to produce films, digital artefacts, artwork, narratives and representations of the lives of Sheffield people, and of this major British city. The project works with people who come from groups which have tended to be socially excluded, such as long-term users of mental health services. Using an exciting blend of techniques and media, Storying Sheffield is creating a living portrait of everyday life in Sheffield, and giving voice to people whose stories are rarely heard. The showcase event happens at 2pm.
