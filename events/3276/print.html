		<td>This event will showcase the findings of the BIG Energy Upgrade Project and will look at the overall impact the project has had including the effectiveness of retrofitting work, the structure of the supply chain and the influence on the behaviour of residents within different communities, and how best to design future projects of the same nature.

BIG Energy Upgrade is Yorkshire and Humber&#39;s first &#39;whole house, whole community&#39; renovation programme.  For the past three years the scheme has helped support some of the region&#39;s most deprived and fuel poor communities with a wide range of energy saving services.
