Deep underneath our city are 44 kilometres of pipework which carry hot water to hundreds of buildings to keep them heated. The heat is generated by burning household rubbish at the Veolia incinerator on Bernard Road. This is a tour of their Sheffield Energy Recovery Facility (ERF) describing Sheffield’s heat network, led by Dr Aimee Ambrose, Sheffield Hallam University. 

Free to attend, but places are limited so book early. Participants must wear sturdy shoes suitable for walking, and be prepared to walk for 45 minutes to 1 hour. This event is not suitable for people with a fear of heights. Part of Understanding Society, the festival of social sciences, organised by the universities (Sheffield and Hallam), funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.
