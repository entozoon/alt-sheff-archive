		<td>People are being taken from our communities and locked up in prison-like detention centres, without time limit, with no idea of when they might be released. Why? They just don’t (yet) have the correct immigration papers... 

This workshop is for anyone who is worried about detention – for yourself or someone else – with information and advice on various things that you do.

To register, please email the name of the person who wants to attend to <a href=mailto:contact@detention.org.uk>contact@detention.org.uk</a>, along with any accessibility needs, they will do their best to accommodate all.</td>
