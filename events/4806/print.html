		<td>Public meeting hosted by Sheffield for Democracy, to explore how referendums have been used and misused in the name of democracy. There is lots of current focus on what Brexit means or doesnâ€™t mean, but little reflection on the referendum process and its implications for democracy. Sheffield for Democracy want to fill the gap.

Speakers: Vicky Seddon and Dr Knut Roder, with Nigel Slack in the chair.

All welcome.
