		<td>Hedge laying is the proper old-fashioned way of looking after hedges as natural fences, instead of slashing them with hedge trimmers. Come for one or two days. Maximum numbers will be 6 per day. Beginners welcome. Rowan will be providing tuition.

Cost: Â£15 per day with proceeds going to Hazelhurst CSA funds. Please make sure your tetanus protection is up to date. Hedging tools will be provided but bring your own if you have them. Bring gloves, wear strong boots and come prepared for cold and wet. Bring your own lunch. Please contact Marion to book: <a href="mailto:marion@hazelhurst.coop">marion@hazelhurst.coop</a>
