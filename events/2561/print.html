		<td>Is Leninism dead? - A Workers Liberty Public meeting. With the crisis in the Socialist Workers&#39; Party bringing into question, for some, the concepts of Leninism and democratic centalism - should the left still use the ideas of Lenin to organise? 

Why do organisations such as Workers&#39; Liberty think we have a lot to learn from Lenin? Is this the death of Leninism?</td>
