		<td>The next Sheffield Humanist Society meeting will be "The Omega Course" with Mike Granville and Mat Baily. A look at popular arguments for god/s, why theyâ€™re wrong and why atheism and humanism are both more compatible with reality, and morally preferable.

The Omega Course will give: Answers to the kind of questions that religious people put to you. Questions for religious people that they might have difficulty in answering, and examine some of the more puzzling bits of the Bible.

The University Arms is close to the tram, get off at the Sheffield University stop, and several buses pass nearby including the 51 & 52, stopping almost next to the pub, with the 95 & 123 a short walk away. Parking is available in the streets behind the pub. You can see a map of the location with this link: <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=university+arms+sheffield">http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=university+arms+sheffield</a>

Organised by the Sheffield Humanist Society.
