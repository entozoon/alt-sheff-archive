		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Allan Hayes, Leicester Secular Society, was Leicester's first Humanist chaplain and will talk about his experiences assisting their Lord Mayor in a city of very diverse faiths and communities. "Whereas a Christian chaplain may have advised the Lord Mayor from a religious perspective, I use a non-religious perspective."

They were interesting times and Allan will cover: cancellation of council prayers; refusal to attend the Civic Service; presumptuousness of the Anglican Church; relations with other religions; remembrance day; the census bus campaign; the diversity of Leicester and its affect on the strategy; differences between Secularism and Humanism.

A talk open to the public, organised by the Sheffield Humanist Society, all welcome. <a href="http://www.sheffieldhumanists.org.uk/">www.sheffieldhumanists.org.uk</a></td>
