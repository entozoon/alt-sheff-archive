		<td>A talk by Stephen Farrall, Professor of Criminology in the School of Law, Sheffield University. He is currently exploring the long term impacts of Thatcherite social and economic policies on crime in England and Wales. In what ways do changes in economic and social policies result in changes in patterns of crime, victimisation and anxieties about crime? How do shifts in social values affect national-level experiences and beliefs about crime and appropriate responses to it (such as support for punitive punishments like the death penalty)? What have been the long-term consequences of almost two decades (1979-1997) of neo-conservative and neo-liberal social and economic policies for the UK’s criminal justice system and the general experience of crime amongst its citizens? 

And what lessons does the recent past offer us today, when policy announcements about further cuts to public expenditure are commonplace and economic growth uncertain and faltering? 

This is a Skeptics in the Pub get-together. These events are free though they ask for a £3 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
