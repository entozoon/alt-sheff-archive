		<td>The recently-elected UK Government has declared its aim to make the UK a “hostile environment” for what it calls ‘illegal’ migrants. 

SYMAAG unites refugee, asylum and migrant organisations with campaign groups and supporting individuals. It campaigns both for the rights of those seeking asylum and of those coming to work in this country. The recently-elected new SYMAAG Executive Committee invites all migrants and their supporters to this meeting to plan responses to the ‘hostile environment’.
