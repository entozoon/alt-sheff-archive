		<td>The racist English Defence League(EDL) have made plans to march through Sheffield on 30th May. Elsewhere in the country, apparently demonstrating against 'extremist Islam', they have in fact violently threated Asian businesses and workers, the local gay district, and anyone who doesn't look like them. More info on this will be posted because it's likely to be a last minute decision. If it goes ahead large numbers of observers and opposition will be needed to turn out and send a strong message against them.

Details will be posted up to last minute at website: <a href="http://yorks-afed.org/">Anarchist Federation (Sheffield)</a></td>
