		<td>An Honest Liar is the brand new biography of leading magician, writer and skeptic James Randi. Randi saw his beloved magicians tricks being used by faith healers, fortune-tellers, and psychics  not for entertainment, but to steal money from innocent people and destroy lives. Enraged by this, he dedicated his life to exposing those frauds, with the wit and style of a great showman. He even transformed his partner, Jose Alvarez, into a fake guru named Carlos to show how easily people can be fooled. A sudden and shocking truth in his personal life was brought to light when the tale of multiple identities took an unexpected and potentially devastating turn.

An Honest Liar is showing in Sheffield at the Odeon on the 10th June at 15.30 and the Showroom on the 11th June at 13.00.

 Skeptics in the Pub events are free though they ask for a Â£3 donation, and the meetings are open to all.
