		<td>Since arriving from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 2001 Bavwidi Mpanzu (or 'Djoly' as his friends know him) has fought for his right to asylum – for 9 years! On 28 Jan, he was arrested and criminalised for trying to support himselves and others. He was sent to Doncaster prison to wait for sentencing at Sheffield Crown Court on 5 March.

He has always supported others in Sheffield: setting up the Africa Time organisation, promoting awareness about African refugees; volunteering at the Centre for HIV and Sexual Health and running a counselling and support service through his role as a pastor in his church organisation. Now it’s time to support Djoly!
