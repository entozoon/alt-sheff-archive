		<td>Oxjam Music Festival takes place every October, with hundreds of volunteer-run events all around the UK, to raise money to help Oxfam fight poverty and suffering around the world.

Oxjam began in 2006, with the aim of creating a network of music-loving people across the UK. You could organise your own event, or perform or help out at a local Oxjam gig. 

Sheffield gigs will be listed here separately. UK-wide details at <a href="http://www.oxfam.org.uk/oxjam/">www.oxfam.org.uk/oxjam</a></td>
