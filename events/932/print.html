		<td>A Cuba Solidarity Campaign public meeting with special guest Keith Bolender. This Canadian author will be signing copies and speaking about his new book, 'Voices from the other side: An oral history of Terrorism against Cuba' which gives a voice to the thousands of Cuban victims of terrorist acts perpetrated against the Cuban people by counter-revolutionary groups based in the USA, often with the active help of the CIA. Bolender provides first hand accounts from victims of more than 1,000 documented attacks against Cuba. 

This will be an informative meeting for activists, journalists and students interested in Latin America and Cuba's relationship with the US. Keith Bolender has lectured on the Cuban revolution at the University of Toronto and written numerous articles on Cuba for the Toronto Star.
