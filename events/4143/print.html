		<td>Award-winning journalist and best-selling author Max Blumenthal comes to Sheffield to speak about <a href="http://newsfromnowhere.tbpcontrol.co.uk/TBP.Direct/PurchaseProduct/OrderProduct/CustomerSelectProduct/SearchProducts.aspx?d=newsfromnowhere&amp;s=C&amp;r=10000022&amp;keywordSearch=The%2051%20Day%20War:%20Resistance%20and%20Ruin%20in%20Gaza">"The 51 Day War" </a>. Last year, this Israeli air strike and ground invasion of Gaza left 10,000 homes destroyed, nearly 300,000 Palestinians displaced, and over 2,000 people dead, the vast majority of them civilians. 

Max Blumenthal was in the area at the time. He reveals shocking evidence of atrocities, and the deceptions that led to it, and argues that it was entirely avoidable. 

Free event.
