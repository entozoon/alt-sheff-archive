		<td>This is an outdoor comedy performance by the Mikron theatre.
Hosted by Green City Action and Sage Greenfingers. The life of the honeybee might be described as one of great sweetness and harmony, punctuated by sudden, desperate, acts of violence. The same could be said for Thistledale... Parking on Grimesthorpe Road. Bring your own blanket or chair.
