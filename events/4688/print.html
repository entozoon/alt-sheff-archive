		<td>Contemporary British artists Sean Williams and Janie Moore present a wry look at what it means to be one of the disenfranchised in today’s Britain. Their exhibition represents the culmination of many years’ critical discussion about art, and their own practice. Williams is a painter whose work is a finely honed tension between the mundane, and impending drama. Moore’s contemporary modes of drawing are an enquiry into surface as volume. Both artists have a desire to explore the psychology and poetics of space and place. Between them, there is emphasis on the melancholy with elements of humour within. 

Preview 12th August 7-9pm
