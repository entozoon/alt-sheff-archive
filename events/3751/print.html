		<td>A lobby of the next meeting of the South Yorkshire Transport Committee, by the campaign to get the authorities to reinstate free train travel. This follows last week’s celebration of charges being dropped against the two South Yorkshire freedom riders who were arrested at Sheffield railway station in June. 

The freedom riders have carried out a long-running campaign for the reversal of cuts in travel passes for older people and disabled people. They organised mass protests where they travelled without tickets between the South Yorkshire towns. 
They won round one in June, getting back free travel for disabled people and half-price on the train for older people.
