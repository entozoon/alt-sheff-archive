		<td>An event open to the public, organised by the Sheffield Humanist Society, all welcome. Hilary Cave asks: As secular humanists we accept no instructions that are said to emanate from a deity. This means that we must accept responsibility for working out how to live our own lives. On what principles should we base our ethical decisions?

This session, which will take the form of a guided discussion, will explore various principles which might form the basis of secular ethical codes.

University Arms is at 197 Brook Hill, Sheffield, S3 7HG (Sheffield University tram stop, or bus: 51 & 52 best; 94 & 95 close by). Meet from 7.30pm for an 8pm start.
