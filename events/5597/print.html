		<td>A one-day session on Modern Activism in Sheffield - 1950 to date, with Nigel Slack, Sheffield citizen activist. The discussion will bring the radical history of the city up to date and give a taste of the campaigns that were key parts of the modern city. From the Poll Tax to the Battle of Orgreave and Nuclear Disarmament to Street Trees, find out more about the campaigns that are still part of today's vibrant radical city.

    Understand Sheffield's unique role in Activism. Learn the role of the activist campaigns in the city since 1950, activism in the modern world, and the role of media and particularly social media in modern activism. 

Bring materials for note taking if you can, but no pre-reading or pre-course work is required. No skills or experience needed, this course is for beginners. It runs on both days at the same time.
