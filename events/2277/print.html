		<td>If God is “the invention of an animal that knows it’s going to die” how do humanists cope with the inevitable? Matthew Simpson explores the wisdom (and wit) of atheists about mortality, and suggests ways humanists can help others get more out of life-before-death.

Matthew is a Humanist Celebrant who conducts funerals as well as weddings and baby namings. He has been a member of the Sheffield Humanist Society for many years.
