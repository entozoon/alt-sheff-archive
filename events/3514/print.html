		<td>WDM aims to change the actions, policies and institutions of governments, corporations and wealthy minorities, which are preventing an end to poverty and injustice. Part of a global movement, it works alongside people protesting in the developing world. 

This month the main agenda item will be to do “fun brainstorming” on an autumn launch for the agri-business campaign. In the name of tackling hunger, UK-funded initiatives like the G8 New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition are helping multinational companies grab African land, seeds and resources. For corporate giants like Unilever and Monsanto, this means vast profit. But for small-scale farmers, who feed most of the population, it means losing control of their livelihoods and the resources needed to grow food. 

The meeting may also look at planning the protest or lobby outside the BAB (British American Business) “roadshow” on October 1st for TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - the proposed “Free Trade“ agreement between the European Union and the United States, currently being negotiated behind closed doors.

<strong>Note the change of venue for the August WDM monthly meeting (the Church House pub is very close to the usual venue, Quaker Meeting House, near Sheffield Cathedral)</strong>
