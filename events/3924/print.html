		<td>Is there a cost of living crisis? With household bills rising and many people earning below the living wage, how should a future government tackle rising living costs? Should public transport fares be regulated? Should people have to rely on food banks, or is this crisis just political hype? Organised in association with Student Voice. 

The Festival of Debate is taking place in Sheffield in the run-up to the General election, during March and April. It provides opportunities to get together and discuss a range of issues which affect everyone. Informed decision making and strategic planning are essential for democracy, so come and get involved. They also welcome volunteers, from attending events and taking part in discussions to volunteering time to help run an event, promote the festival and much more. Unless otherwise stated events are free to attend, but if possible please register via the appropriate Eventbrite link on the Festival of Debate website below to give organsisers an idea of numbers.
