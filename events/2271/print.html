		<td>Sheffield Palestive Solidarity Campaign event in aid of children&#39;s projects. A recent UN report states ‘The long-term prospects for Palestinian economic development became even more unattainable ... The impact of occupation on the Palestinian productive base, especially the agriculture sector, has been devastating. The economy has lost access to 40 per cent of West Bank land, 82 per cent of its ground water, and more than two thirds of its grazing land. In Gaza, half of the cultivable area and 85 per cent of fishery resources are inaccessible.’

Sheffield Palestive Solidarity Campaign cannot alter the grim economic reality, but its small scale material support for Palestinian children helps with libraries, books, play materials etc. Raising the money is a real gesture of solidarity and is part of the campaign to get justice for the Palestinians. Join them for a delicious meal, stimulating film and a highly enjoyable evening. Come along, bring a friend.
