		<td>Residents Against Station Closure (RASC) campaigns to stop East Midlands Trains installing barriers at Sheffield Station. Ticket barriers will prevent many people walking through the station to gain access to the city centre or the tram stop which is at the back of the station. 

We thought it was all over, but itâ€™s not. East Midlands Trains (EMT) have recently mounted a human barrier on at least one occasion to prevent people without train tickets crossing the bridge. They intend to plough on with the installation of barriers, despite huge public opposition.

In response RASC is holding a demo to tell EMT that we are still here and we still mean business. To re-assert the right to free travel across the bridge by crossing it forwards and backwards. Please come along to support the campaign.
