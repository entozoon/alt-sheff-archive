		<td>Come on down to The Sheffield Alternative Election to engage in some direct democracy!

This is call for policies. Policies you would like to see implemented. Policies that you would like to define your government; your country. The Sheffield Alternative Election team invite you to submit anything, including policies that revise the very system they are proposing. They invite you to design a better future for Sheffield, to be presented at a launch party on the night of the general election...

/////////////
Don&#39;t let yourself deflate with the post-voting blues! 
Let&#39;s feel excited about the future again!
/////////////


Open from 1st May 12-4pm, then on Thursday 7th May, at 8pm, the creation and launch of the new Sheffield Constitution. Come and help put it together, enjoy a range of guests speakers, live voting experiments and a carefully considered ration of fun!
