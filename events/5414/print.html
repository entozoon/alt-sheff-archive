		<td>The world première of a play by Kate Bowen. Cormack, Findlay and Davies are the elite. They are the first generation of female soldiers to serve in the British infantry in close combat roles, ever. They’ve aced physical tests only 5% of female soldiers can pass; they’ve been trained to shoot, fight and kill. They’ve proven their exceptional skill and discipline – while everyone around them questions whether they should even be allowed to serve. And now they’re about to join the action.
 
A co-production between Sheffield Theatres and Out of Joint. Suitable for ages 14+. Contains strong language and sexual references. Box Office Sheff 2496000.
