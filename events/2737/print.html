They also ask everyone to bring a bit of cold food to share, all veggie; eg. olives, salad, cheese, quiche/flan, cake, sweet pie/tart; fruit, bread, crisps, tortilla chips, etc. Soup will be served, and beer, in return for donations of Â£1.30 a pint.

The ride will also visit sites of grow your own schemes, eg Lowes Garden, Common Ground, Hollinsend Community Garden, Heeley City Farm, and pass by some allotments on the way to and back from Hazelhurst Coop. Many of these are covered by the umbrella of <a href="http://www.transitionsheffield.org.uk/">Transition Sheffield</a>

At Hazlehurst workers and volunteers will talk about what they do and how it all works. You may even want to know about volunteering yourself.

Sheffield FridayNightRide has been going for nearly 5 years, this ride will be the 60th ride - the Diamond Jubilee. Loads more details on the website below.
