		<td>Black Rope Walking Group is a good excuse for libertarians and anarchists to get together for pleasant days walking in the hills round Sheffield. This time it's the 7 mile Deepcar circular walk. Deepcar is on the A6102 about 8 miles NW from Sheffield city centre. The walk has wonderful contrasting views from the industrial valley of the Little Don to viewpoints of the steel industry and the hills beyond towards Wortley. 

Note the walk includes several stiles, unsuitable for prams and wheelchairs, and maybe muddy in places, so use sturdy footwear. Some road walking and 2 short sections of ascent. And the good news: Refreshments in pubs at Deepcar, Green Moor and Wortley.

Meet at Sheffield Interchange 11.30am for 57/58 bus to Deepcar
