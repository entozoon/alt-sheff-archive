		<td>Liberty is hosting this event in support of student Richard O’Dwyer, who is facing extradition to the USA on charges of copyright infringement, due to the UK’s unfair extradition laws. Richard is charged with hosting a website, built from his Sheffield bedroom, offering links to downloadable pirate films and TV shows, which is not a crime in the UK. He faces trial in the USA, the first British citizen extradited to the US because of copyright infringement laws.

Liberty Director Shami Chakrabarti, Richard’s mother Julia O’Dwyer and others will be speaking.
