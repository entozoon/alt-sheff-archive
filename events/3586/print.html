		<td>WDM aims to change the actions, policies and institutions of governments, corporations and wealthy minorities, which are preventing an end to poverty and injustice. Part of a global movement, it works alongside people protesting in the developing world. 

This month: planning a lobby of the British American Business roadshow when it comes to Sheffield on Wed. 1st October, and another action for the <a href="http://www.nottip.org.uk/">noTTIP campaign</a>.

The meeting of WDM is held on the first Thursday of each month, to discuss coming events and campaigns. It is usually followed by informal gathering in the nearby <i>Church House</i> pub, approx. 9.15-10.15pm. If you plan to come only to the pub then please contact (phone 07800 666553 or leave a message at the QMH), as occasionally the group does not go to the pub.
