		<td>A talk by Guy Otten, Chair of Greater Manchester Humanists. Most people know that much of the origins of Christianity and Judaism is mythological, but it is not so widely known that Islam’s origins are similarly mythical. Research has been accumulating that Islam did not exist until about 690CE (six decades after Muhammad’s death), when a political decision appears to have been made to adopt a new religion. Islam was then developed for another 150-200 years.
