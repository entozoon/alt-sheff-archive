		<td>Last week, thousands crowded into Barkers Pool against Boris Johnson and his Brexit Parliamentary prorogation. It was apparently the <a href="https://www.thestar.co.uk/news/people/thousands-of-people-gather-for-political-protest-in-sheffield-city-centre-493240">biggest demonstration in Sheffield in a decade</a>, and part of the UK-wide pressure to defend democracy, in the streets. 

This week, after rallying at Barkers Pool there will be a march, with promise of a better sound system this time. Organised by Sheffield Left Against Brexit, Another Europe Is Possible, and other green/left wing labour-movement-based campaigners.
