		<td>Emerging from roots in the late 90s lo-fi and psych folk, Chris T-T first gained acclaim for sarcastic, city-obsessed urban alt-folk music before developing into an influential figure of UK songwriting, crossing barriers between punk, psych and English folk. Chris will discuss his 2005 album of protest songs, 9 Red Songs, and its forthcoming companion piece, 9 Green Songs, before performing a full set.
