		<td>Ashes and Diamonds is a tribute to the mining industry and those who fought so long and hard to defend it. It also aims to raise awareness and debate on relevant issues for today, from the ongoing theft from the Mineworkers Pension fund to the loss of all of our once great industries. The creator, Darren Coffield, is a leading London artist.

Arthur Scargill, Honorary President NUM (National Union of Mineworkers) officially welcomes the exhibition back to South Yorkshire after a world tour, at Wortley Hall, (the &#34;workers&#39; stately hall&#34;) where it will be open until the 13th November.

Alongside the official opening, a public meeting, &#34;From the Miners Strike to the Current Capitalist Crisis&#34; will be held with former Vice President of Yorkshire NUM, Ken Capstick joining the speakers. 

Further events on the 8th and 11th, see below.
Organised by the <a href="http://www.justiceformineworkers.org.uk/">National Justice for Mineworkers Campaign</a> and supported by Derbyshire NUM
