		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Latest national meeting of groups opposed to the global human rights abuses of G4S, which continues to hit the headlines with its incompetence and terrible actions in the UK, Palestine, South Africa and beyond. Resistance to G4S is gaining ground and the company is losing contracts with universities and companies as its track record of abuse is exposed. Campaigners are calling for corporate manslaughter charges after an inquest into the death of Jimmy Mubenga, who died at the hands of G4S guards, recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. Event organised by <a href="http://stopg4s.net/">Stop G4S</a>.

Doors open at 10am.
