		<td>The first ever Eco-International Festival to be held to promote the proposed Dearne Valley Eco-Vision initiative for the area. Organizers Transform South Yorkshire and Sheffield City Region have flown in a host of national and international speakers on various related topics. 

Transform South Yorkshire was one of the last government's (now abolished?) Housing Market Renewal Area 'Pathfinders' which helped established housing market restructuring (with mass demolition programmes) in partnership with local authorities. It was criticised for paying insufficient attention to the issue of community cohesion, local jobs, community support and for the absence of a value for money strategy in an <a href="http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/housing/marketrenewalpathfinders/reports/transformsouthyorkshireperformancereviews/Pages/transformsouthyorkshireperformancereview2009.aspx">Audit Commission Performance Review published in 2010</a>

Sheffield City Region looks set to take on some of the work of the axed Yorkshire Forward (EU/government development agency for Yorkshire and Humberside).

The Dearne valley is a large ex-coalmining area between Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster. It is home to numerous EU-funded call-centres, and Conisbrough's 'Earth Centre', subject to <a href="http://welovetheearthcentre.blogspot.com/"> controversial sell-off plans.</a>
