    Another announcement of the end of the world?
    More faith and creationist schools?
    Outrageous happenings in a local church?
    Bishops in the Lords?
    The Pope converts to Islam?
    Gay marriage?

Sheffield Humanist Society does not pretend to be able to predict the future or know what the current events will be. So come along to hear about and discuss the news from a Humanist point of view.
