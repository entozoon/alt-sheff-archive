		<td>This open meeting is for anyone who supports, or would like to hear more about the health, social and economic benefits of lower speed limits in appropriate areas. In February 2011 Sheffield Council adopted the following motion: "To bring forward plans for city-wide 20mph limits on residential roads..." John Bann, Head of Transport, Traffic & Parking Services, will give an update on how the Council is progressing with the implementation of lower speed limits in Sheffield, and future rollout plans.

There will also be feedback by a Sheffield resident from the recent 4th National 20mph Conference, followed by discussions about how this group can continue to promote safer speeds. The meeting is organised by the 20splentyforsheffield group, which promotes the benefits of lower speed limits where people live, work, shop and play in Sheffield.
