		<td>A casual drinks event for anyone in the Sheffield and South Yorkshire area interested in green issues and the environment. Come along if you want to get to know like-minded people, discuss green issues and what’s happening in our local community. Organised by Sheffield and Rotherham Green Party, the event is open to all and they encourage anyone who is interested in their local community to come along and join the discussion. You are very warmly invited. The event will focus on helping to build links between grass-roots community groups, campaigns and activities.

Bring your own drinks, bring a friend or two and enjoy some relaxed discussions both before and after the event. If you’d like to bring snacks; feel free to. If you can, tell them you can come as it helps to predict numbers but you don’t need to though, it’s a casual meet up. Click below to find out more or to let them know you are coming.
