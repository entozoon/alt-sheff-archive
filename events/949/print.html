Honeybees have been mysteriously disappearing across the planet, literally vanishing from their hives. In the UK, around one fifth of honeybee hives were lost in the winter 2008/09. Bees pollinate a third of the food we eat, and this contributes £200 million a year to the UK economy. Vanishing of the Bees, is an eye-opening account of the shocking truth behind the declining bee population.
