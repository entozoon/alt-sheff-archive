		<td>Join the national demonstration against ATOS which has the contract for enforcing the cruel and unnecessary welfare cuts, targeting the sick and disabled for the DWP. 144 national events are planned today, covering every ATOS centre. 

According to <a href="http://www.schnews.org.uk/stories/DO-YOU-GIVE-ATOS/">Schnews</a>, the Work Capability Assessment is part of the government&#39;s drive to target anyone in receipt of state benefits â€“ an effort to force people off sickness and disability benefits onto the cheaper Job Seeker&#39;s Allowance.

Even leaving aside the morality of the political onslaught on the poorest, ATOS administration of the WCA has been cack-handed from the beginning, coming in from criticism from the Public Audit Office. 40% of appeals against ATOS &#39;back to work&#39; decisions are successful. They&#39;ve repeatedly told terminally ill people that they&#39;re fit for work and removed their benefits. In a further twist of the screw benefits are now suspended during the appeals process, leaving victims nowhere to turn except food banks.

This really is a national day of action so look for your local assessment centre and get down there!
