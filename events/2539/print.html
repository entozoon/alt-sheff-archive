Despite great advances in technology and communications, millions of people in the UK are unemployed, including one million young people. Worldwide, billions live in hunger and want.

The crisis that began in 2008 has revealed itself as far more than an economic downturn; it is the failure of an entire social system - capitalism.

The <b><a href="http://www.iysse.com/" target="_BLANK">International Youth and Students for Social Equality</a></b>, the student movement of the Socialist Equality Party and the International Committee of the Fourth International, fights for the revival of a socialist movement among young people throughout the country, as part of an international socialist movement of the entire working class.   The IYSSE stands in the tradition of revolutionary socialism, from the origins of Marxism in the 1840s, through the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the implacable struggle, led by Leon Trotsky, against the bureaucratic degeneration of the Soviet Union under Stalin. In the 21st century, the IYSSE, SEP and ICFI are fighting to unify and mobilise the working class and youth internationally, to prepare the working class for the conquest of political power and the establishment of a genuinely democratic, egalitarian and socialist society.
