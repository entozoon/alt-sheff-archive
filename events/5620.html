	<p class="message">Join Sheffield&#39;s food for purpose organisations in the ShefFood Village at the Sheffield Food Festival. Explore the issues, meet the people and seize the opportunities to change the health, equality, economy and sustainability of food and drink in Sheffield for the better, for everyone! There will be hands-on activities and people who will talk with you.<strong>Food Explorers Trail, Sat - Mon, 11-6pm </strong>Have fun exploring the Sheffield Food Festival with the ShefFood Explorers Trail. Follow the trail, answer the questions and get your reward! Learn fun food facts and how your food system works. Pick up the trail leaflet from Regather in the ShefFood Village. Suitable for all ages. <strong>Food For Thought &#39;Table Talks&#39;, Sat - Mon, 12-4pm </strong>Curious about food and how we feed ourselves? Passionate about better food for everyone? Look out for the &#39;ShefFood&#39; t-shirts and the &#39;Table Talks&#39; signs and join them to share food, drink and conversation together and learn how we can all work together to make the food system in Sheffield better for everyone. <strong>Mr & Mrs VegHead, Sat - Mon, 12-2pm </strong>A Sheffield Food Festival twist to everyone&#39;s favourite Mr Potato Head, everything you need to make a crazy fruit and veg head will be provided. There will be fruit and veg head selfies to share on social media, and a competition for the best head ever! Suitable for all ages. <strong>No Junk Fruit Juicing, Sat, 2-4pm </strong>Kids love drinking fruit juice, but do they know how easy it is to make? Kids can get hands on and messy as they learn about the simple process of making (and drinking!) fruit juice. Fresh fruit, leftover fruit or any fruit that would otherwise go to waste will be available to use, so it&#39;s a great opportunity to learn about reducing food waste too. <strong>Keeping Chickens At Home, Sun, 2-4pm </strong>Kids love visiting the farm and learning where their food comes from. Kids also love taking care of pets. Keeping chickens is a great way to combine both, plus the family gets to eat fresh, tasty eggs. There will be a small flock of hens to watch and feed, and people who are passionate about chickens to talk with. <strong>Kids Seed Sowing, Mon, 2-4pm </strong>Once they have grown their own, kids love growing their own veg. They are more likely to eat them and they&#39;ll have learned a little bit about where food comes from. Kids can decorate their own pot and plant some veggie seeds to take home. Even if you don&#39;t have a garden you can grow your own delicious vegetables in a window box or on a balcony, it&#39;s easy! <strong>Disco Soup, Sat - Mon, 4-6pm </strong>Join the party to collect, chop, and cook leftover food or any food that would otherwise go to waste. The music will be pumping, everyone will be dancing and we&#39;ll all enjoy delicious soup! Part of Festival of Debate 2019, in association with SHEF FOOD and the Sheffield Food Festival.
