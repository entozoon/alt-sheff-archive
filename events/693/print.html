		<td>Faith schools are a big concern. Many restrict pupils' development by putting belief before observation and exploration. We know how much damage sectarian schools do in Northern Ireland and we have great concerns about creating more schools that can provide more social division. Faith schools are also used for back door segregation so that pushy parents can create and gain access to selective schools.

Are these concerns justified or do faith schools offer a high quality education with good social and moral integration as they claim? John Coldron, Sheffield Hallam University Director of the Centre for Education and Inclusion Research with particular research experience in the field of parents and schools, presents a talk for Sheffield Humanist Society, open to the public, all welcome.

University Arms, 197 Brook Hill, Sheffield, S3 7HG. The University Arms is close to the tram, get off at the Sheffield University stop, and several buses pass nearby including 51 & 52, stopping almost next to the pub, with 94 & 95 a short walk away. Parking is available in the streets behind the pub.
