		<td>Co-operatives have played a big part in the history of Sheffield, and many are alive and well today. Come and experience a showcase of co-operatives contributing to the success of people power. This event, part of Heritage Open Days 2019, takes place in a co-operatively owned listed building, Aizlewood’s Mill. Co-operatives in many areas of activity will be presenting what they do. 

Co-operatives create culture and common wealth through collective self-help in working class communities. This event celebrates the unique values and principles of the co-operative movement.

Free, no booking required. Organised by <a href="https://www.principle5.coop/">Principle 5 Yorkshire Co-operative Resource Centre</a>. Full details below.
