		<td>A public meeting run by Sheffield Palestinian Solidarity Campaign. When people from a different culture and tradition offer solidarity to an oppressed people there is a huge scope for unlooked-for problems. This meeting will address these important issues, with speaker Tanzil Chowdhury.

Palestinian food will be provided, meat and vegetarian, in the tradition of meals as an enjoyable acts of solidarity. Money is desperately needed for the children&#39;s projects in Gaza, so this is a fund raiser. The new Sheffield Palestine Calendar will be available.
