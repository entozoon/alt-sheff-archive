		<td>Self-proclaimed worldwide security force G4S had been responsible for deaths in its "care", long before it showed its true carelessness by messing up the London Olympics contract. G4S have now breached their contract to re-house asylum seekers in Yorkshire and Humberside, so the UK Borders Agency have (again) extended another deadline. There has been extensive national media coverage of the evolving scandal, and there are now local, regional and national Stop G4S campaigns including these Sheffield meetings.
