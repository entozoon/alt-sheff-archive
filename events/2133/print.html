		<td>Sheffield Stop the War Coalition has called this meeting in opposition to western intervention in Syria. After Iraq and Libya, is Syria in line for destruction by the west? The growing threats against Iran in recent weeks have been backed up with increased sanctions. As we know from Iraq, these are a prelude to war, not an alternative to it. There are signs of covert intervention already in Iran, as there are in Syria. Stop the War opposes all military intervention from the west in the region, for which there is absolutely no justification. The world will not get fooled again after the experience of Libya, where a supposed intervention &#39;to save civilians&#39; developed into a regime change war, which cost at least 30,000 lives in Libya.<ul><li>Speakers:</li><li>Jeremy Corbyn MP</li><li>Maxine Bowler - Sheffield Anti Cuts Alliance</li><li>Al Hussein Abutaleb – Chair, Black Students Committee, Sheffield University</li><li>Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign</li><li>Other speakers to confirm</li></ul>£2 admission
