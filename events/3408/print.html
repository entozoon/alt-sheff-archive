		<td>Nader Al Masri is an elite athlete, an Olympian, a marathon runner. He was denied clearance by Israel to travel from Gaza to the Palestine Marathon this year. Please join Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign as an act of solidarity, in a joint event with Gaza. This community fun run, round the 1K 'Unity Loop' will be followed by food and games at U-Mix centre, Lowfield. Friends and comrades in Gaza, at the Afeq Jadeeda children's centre will be running at the same time and they will be talking to them to set the starters orders. Bring your friends. You can run, walk, skip, as you like: it is a fun run NOT a race!

Full details including sign-up and sponsorship forms are on the website below. Entry fee: Â£3 minimum, more if you can, this includes food.
