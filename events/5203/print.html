		<td>Sharrow Lantern Carnival was set up in 2004 as a celebration of the first anniversary of the end of the Iraq war. The group who originally began the carnival wanted to bring peaceful protest to the streets of Sharrow. Today they keep to these morals by celebrating the creative community in Sharrow. The carnival takes place annually in April and there are free lantern making workshops running from February. The theme for this year is "Monster Mash"!
