Brigantii Brigantii (fresh upbeat reggae)
The Boston Steemers (high energy rock ‘n’ roll)
Ben Lydiat (loop peddle mastery and sweet vocals)
Andrew Duxfield (acoustic folk/blues)
Carl ‘on fire’ Watkins (Carl’s stomping delta blues style can create a high level of excitement, capable of leaving the crowd joyously enlightened. He plays a mixture of well written originals and traditional blues songs)

£3 entry on the door. Note: Penelopes is not easy to find the first time, unless you know that the door is on the <i>side</i> of the Odeon Cinema building.
