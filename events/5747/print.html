		<td>The 6th mass species extinction and abrupt, runaway climate change is here. Societal collapse and mass death are seen as inevitable by scientists and other credible voices, with human extinction also a possibility, if rapid action is not taken. 

Join Extinction Rebellion Sheffield in this march from Union St. (12.40pm) to Sheffield Town Hall (1pm) to reaffirm the declaration of rebellion against our ecocide government. 

The demand is that all levels of government should tackle the climate and ecological crises. Humanity is in an event unprecedented in its history, unless immediately addressed, we face the destruction of this nation, its peoples, our ecosystems and the future of generations to come. There is no time to delay when the safety and security rests on appropriate government legislation.

All levels of government must tell the truth about the severity of the climate crisis. The government must commit to carbon neutrality by 2025. The government must create a citizen’s assembly to guide their reaction to the climate and ecological crisis.			

<strong>Extinction Rebellion’s <a href="https://rebellion.earth/declaration/">key demands</a> are:

     The Government must tell the truth about the ecological emergency, reverse inconsistent policies and work alongside the media to communicate with citizens

    The Government must enact legally binding policy measures to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2025 and to reduce consumption levels

    A national Citizens’ Assembly to oversee the changes, as part of creating a democracy fit for purpose.
