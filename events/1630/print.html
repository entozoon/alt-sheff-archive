		<td>Two-day course on making a basic rustic chair, working with green wood, freshly felled. This is soft and easy to work with hand tools, and because of this, green woodwork creates little waste. It uses small trees and logs, so it is green in all senses of the word. Anyone can do this course, with little or no experience.
