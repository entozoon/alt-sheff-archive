		<td>Previously held at Ponds Forge, this is a marketplace of stalls for buying and sell new and used bikes, parts and other cycling stuff. Rather bigger than the twice-a-year <a href="https://sheffieldcyclejumble.wordpress.com/">Sheffield Cycle Jumble</a> (last was Sat 27 Oct 2018) because it includes bike retailers and bike manufacturers.

The venue, "Magna Science and Adventure Centre" is between Sheffield and Rotherham, close to the M1 motorway near Meadowhall, on various bus and cycle routes. Easy venue access, parking is free. Tickets on the door: adults £5, children £2.50 (4-14yrs), under 4 free. Eventbrite advance booking includes an "Early Bird ticket (£8) which allows access from 10am.
