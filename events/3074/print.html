		<td>Talk by Neil Denny, producer and presenter of the Little Atoms Radio Show and podcast. Neil was the recipient of a Travelling Fellowship from the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, and in 2012 he embarked upon a month long, 6614 mile road trip across America to produce a series of podcasts which present a wide-ranging overview of science and skepticism from an American perspective. Neil recorded 39 interviews with scientists and science writers. The podcasts from Neil’s trip can be found at <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/littleatomsroadtrip">http://feeds.feedburner.com/littleatomsroadtrip</a>. 

Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. Talks are typically about a common belief that can be demonstrated to be false or cannot be justified by the available evidence. These events are free though they ask for a £3 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
