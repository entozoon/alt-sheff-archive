		<td>A workshop to explore power and diversity in relationship. A one-day workshop with Leah Bijelić and Mike Fitter

In situations where you feel that you’re not seen or taken seriously, do others dismiss your concerns as an overreaction? Do you sometimes feel confused and frustrated at people’s reactions to you? In situations where you have authority and feel responsibility? Do you find yourself hesitant and tentative around issues of diversity – e.g. with people of other races, religions, sexual identity, ability or gender? 

Booking (Limited places – book early to avoid disappointment): Individuals: £80 (some reduced cost places available – please enquire). Organisation: £120. A deposit of £40 will secure your place. (Cheques payable to Process Work Sheffield).
