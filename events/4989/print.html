		<td>Various groups have claimed to be the champions of democracy, ‘rule by the people’. Angie Hobbs asks who are ‘the people’, what really constitutes ‘rule’ by the people, and how does democracy differ from demagoguery? She argues that democracy is genuinely under threat, and why, for all its faults, it is nevertheless vital to preserve it.
