		<td>Brian Webster is a postgraduate research student at the University of Sheffield whose research interests include globalisation and sustainable development. His PhD thesis focuses on the role played by the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions. In this talk Brian will discuss the often-overlooked role these organisations play, in everything from international climate change negotiations to the politics of austerity, while arguing that the power of globalisation need not erode the ability of local communities and individuals to effect meaningful change.

Admission: Donations please. One of many events which are part of Broomhill Festival.
