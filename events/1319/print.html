		<td>All women are welcome to join this gathering which marks the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day and is in support of 'No women, no peace'. a coalition of aid and peace organisations-
Amnesty, Act!onaid, Oxfam, UNIFEM, WOMANKIND WORLDWIDE, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, iansa, WOMEN for WOMEN international, gender action for peace and security, International Alert, Widows for Peace through Democracy and care.

10 years ago the UK supported the United Nations  Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security.This recognised the devastating impact  of conflict on women, and states that women must be involved in building peace from the earliest stages.
A decade later change is still not being felt by women.

No women, no peace. is calling on the UK government to promote and actively support women's participation in peacebuilding by:
1. Mandating a minister to actively advance govt action on women, peace and security
2. Establishing a high-level taskforce of senior govt officials mandated to drive forward this work across relevant departments
3. Allocating specific funds for women within peace and security initiatives
4. Accounting for action taken to support women in conflict annually to Parliament, the UN and the public.

Everyone is welcome to sign a petition asking Lynne Featherstone MP, the government's Champion for tackling International Violence Against Women, to make women in conflict a top priority and to send a postcard to their MP asking her/him to raise this issue with the Foreign Secretary.</td>
