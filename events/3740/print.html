The theme is climate change, so bring any questions you have regarding carbon reductions, fracking, energy security, green jobs, air pollution, renewable energy and other environmental concerns. Hosted by the University of Sheffield, and convened by Sheffield People and Planet and Sheffield Climate Alliance as a chance to find out what your candidates think, and to influence their own opinions and party policies.

The event will kick off with an introduction from Sheffield City Council cabinet member for the environment, Jack Scott (Labour) who will outline the work going on in Sheffield to help combat climate change, and prepare us for the local effects.
