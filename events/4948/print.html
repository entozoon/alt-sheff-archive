		<td>A half day exploring what is out there: What you see, how come it is there, questions it raises. More and more of our blank walls and gable ends now carry images. Some commissioned, some arriving spontaneously and subversively. Feature Walls is the recent initiative. There are incredible efforts inside derelict factories, and “tagged” signatures all over the place. And some images have been over painted, defaced: a process of expression and criticism that is visible but often deliberately anonymous. 

This morning event gives us space to explore just what is going on. Images, analysis, discussion, controversy.
