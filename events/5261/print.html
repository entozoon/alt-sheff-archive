		<td>Community Energy England and Sheffield Renewables invite you to a screening of the documentary “Human Energy” by Adam Dzienis.

Completed in 2017, "Human Energy" is a movie about renewable energy, told through the stories of pioneers, founders and members of energy cooperatives across Europe. It takes a look at how community groups are fundamentally changing how energy is produced, consumed and managed by decarbonising, decentralising and democratising the energy system and truly taking power back. The documentary has been selected as a finalist and semi-finalist in a range of international festivals.

The event organisers hope the film will help attendees to grasp the ideas and values behind the community energy movement and inspire them to take action as part of the Community Energy Fortnight campaign.

Licensed bar open from 7pm. The event starts at 7.30pm. Please note the venue has two flights of stairs and unfortunately no wheelchair access.
