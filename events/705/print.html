No Recourse to Public Funds – what's it about? Women who enter the UK on Spousal Visas must be supported financially by their partner for 2 years before they can apply for 'indefinite leave to remain'. They have No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF) during that time, so can't work or claim benefits or social housing. If a woman is subjected to domestic abuse, she can be trapped in a very dangerous situation. The Domestic Violence Rule of 2002 means that if she leaves her partner during those 2 years, and can prove domestic abuse was the cause, she can apply to remain in the UK in her own right, but has no means of support while her case is being assessed. In Sheffield, this local fund enables the local domestic abuse projects to apply for a short term grant on behalf of women with No Recourse, to aid the projects in supporting their most destitute service users.
