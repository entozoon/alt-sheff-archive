		<td>There is a national campaign against Sodastream because it makes machines that make water fizzy in an Israeli settlement on the West Bank. These settlements are illegal and an obstacle to peace, see more details at <a href="http://www.sodastreamboycott.org/">www.sodastreamboycott.org</a>.

Saturday 28th September is a national day of protest against Sodastream. John Lewis sells these machines. Join the gathering at 12 noon at the Barkers Pool entrance to John Lewis. An event run by Sheffield Palestinian Solidarity Campaign.
