		<td>How can we cut carbon emissions in our day-to-day lives? ‘Carbon Conversations’ is a series of 6 meetings (3 weeks apart) that covers topics like energy, transport, food and waste.   They bring people together in a friendly way to learn about the scientific views and share ideas about what we can all do in our homes and work-places. The approach is informal and non-judgemental and is now being run by volunteers in cities across the country. The cost of the series is £20 per person, to cover handbook and teas/coffees (£25 for a couple sharing a handbook.) If you are interested please fill in this short survey about your availability and needs: <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/QKR9TB3">www.surveymonkey.com/s/QKR9TB3</a>
