		<td>Comedian, #periodpositive founder and sex educator Chella Quint, performs her five-star show about all things period: the good, the bad and the bloody. As heard on BBC Radio 4’s A Bleeding Shame and Woman’s Hour, Chella wittily deconstructs menstrual stigma and joyfully invites audiences to hang ten on a crimson wave in this taboo-breaking period comedy about ending period poverty with ad-busting, craftivism and a bleeding ridiculous conga line.
