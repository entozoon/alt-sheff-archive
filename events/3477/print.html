		<td>Eurig Scandrett on the catastrophic impact on Palestinians of Israelâ€™s occupation, colonisation, and apartheid. Also film premiere of "Enduring Roots: Over a Century of Resistance to the JNF" (35 minutes). The Jewish National Fund (JNF) is an international organisation intent on securing land for Jewish people in Israel. Much of the land it currently owns has been stolen from Palestinians - villages evacuated during the Nakba for example. Its charitable status in the UK is being challenged as a result of its activities.
