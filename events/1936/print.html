		<td>In 1927, Bertrand Russell delivered his famous lecture, "Why I am not a Christian", which encapsulated the ethical and philosophical case against Christianity. 85 years later his criticisms are commonplace and Christianity can no longer demand social and political dominance based on its supposed truth. Instead, it does so on the basis of its claimed cultural importance. The purpose of this talk is to challenge that claim.

Dan Bye is an active commentator on humanist and secular issues. He is on the council of the <a href="http://www.secularism.org.uk/">National Secular Society</a>.

The University Arms is close to the tram, get off at the Sheffield University stop, and several buses pass nearby including the 51 & 52, stopping almost next to the pub, with the 95 & 123 a short walk away.
