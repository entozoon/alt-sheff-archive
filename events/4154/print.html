		<td>The biggest ever protest against immigration detention in the UK took place on June 6th, both inside and outside Yarls Wood detention centre near Bedford. South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG) was a part of it. Many of the women on the protest had previously been detained there. Some of the women still detained at Yarls Wood say that they have been treated with a little more respect since that protest: <a href="http://rt.com/uk/265732-yarls-wood-detention-improvements/"> video at RT. </a>

You can read a report and see a video of this huge and inspiring protest from the Guardian <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/06/hundreds-protest-at-yarls-wood-demand-closure">here</a> and from protest organisers <a href="https://www.facebook.com/movementforjustice">The Movement for Justice</a>. There is also a brief <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/South-Yorkshire-Migration-and-Asylum-Action-Group/1457376101169518?fref=nf">SYMAAG report on Facebook</a>.

The next demonstration against Yarls Wood is on August 8th, to go along get in touch with SYMAAG.
