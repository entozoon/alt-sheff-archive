		<td>Sheffield Social Centre is a non-hierarchical, anti-capitalist space based on a number of core principles which reflect the world its organisers want to see: co-operation and mutual aid, openness and inclusion, voluntary participation and shared responsibility, where discrimination of any kind is challenged in order to create as inclusive a place as possible. 

One way of achieving this is through open meetings like this, using consensus decision-making. All welcome.
