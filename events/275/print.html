		<td>Anyone is welcome to go along and get involved with clearing and planting about 6-8 trees on a nice sunny south facing bank between Marden Road and Edgedale Road next to Lowes Paint shop.

A great opportunity for people to not only get some fresh local food, but also learn something about the process of growing edible plants. Forest Gardens consist of perennial shrubs and trees planted to mimic the canopy layers of a natural woodland, but all the planting is edible or useful in some way. The Project will help regenerate an unused and untidy pocket of land. 

Organised by Gus, a council comunity forester, and supported by GROW Sheffield, Abbeydale Communities Together (ACT) and the Abundance Project. Contact Angus Hunter on 07855 225172 or email <a href="mailto:angus.hunter@sheffield.co.uk">angus.hunter@sheffield.co.uk</a></td>
