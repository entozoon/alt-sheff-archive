		<td>Every year the breeding Hen Harrier survey shows these amazing birds edging closer to extinction. It is because breeding adults mysteriously disappear in the Forest of Bowland and the Peak District, illegally killed by gamekeepers working for grouse moors so that the rich can shoot grouse. This has to stop. If you care about animal welfare, conservation, or would like to know more about our birds of prey please join in Hen Harrier Weekend 2017.

Speakers; Natalie Bennett, former Green Party Leader, Dr Ross Cameron, Senior Lecturer - Landscape Management, Ecology & Design at the University of Sheffield, Dr Mark Avery, campaigner and author. Organised by Sheffield Environmental and Birders Against Wildlife Crime.
