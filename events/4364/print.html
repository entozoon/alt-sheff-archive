 Free online resources
 Free access to online coaching

 Anyone taking part in the vegan month needs to arrive for the launch event on Saturday 4th June, from 10am-4pm.

An Introduction to Veganism workshop will be followed by a Free Vegan Food Fair at the same venue, with your chance to sample an amazing selection of sweet and savoury vegan dishes.The food fair will be open to the public from 12 noon.

 If you would like to donate to help covering funds for this event, <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/ndk2qfdg">click here</a> or contact the group to donate by cash/cheque.

 Already vegan? They need lots of promotion of the event, volunteers on the day to help make it successful, and experienced vegans who would like to act as "buddies" for the month, supporting and advising Vegan Approach participants. Please get in touch if you would like to help.
