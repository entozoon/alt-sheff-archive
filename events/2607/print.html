		<td>A peaceful Sheffield 'Unite Against Fascism' stall and leafleting session. Last week the fascist BNP had a stall in our city centre. Sheffield has a proud tradition of standing in unity against fascism and racism. A BNP stall in our city centre is a cynical attempt to spread racist lies in order to divide our city. Join in unity to show that the overwhelming majority of Sheffield rejects the BNP and everything it stands for.
