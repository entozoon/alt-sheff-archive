		<td>Locked up. Shipped around. Sold for sex. In the black of night ‘Tanja‘ fled to safety and was locked up in Yarl’s Wood Immigration Removal Centre; Britain’s best kept secret. Refuge lies just beyond the barbed wire fence, but at what cost? The story of one woman’s bravery in the midst of prejudice and abuse. ‘Tanja’ is an impassioned call to arms, a play and a campaign which blends spoken word, drama, dance, puppetry, live music, sign language and verbatim theatre. It stars former Yarl’s Wood detainee Emily Ntshangase-Wood. 

Some free tickets and subsidised tickets available. Online trailer <a href="https://vimeo.com/176805247">link here </a>. Organised by ASSIST Sheffield, in partnership with City of Sanctuary.
