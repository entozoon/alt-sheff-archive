		<td>As part of the national Save our Libraries Day of Action, Library Workers for a Brighter Future present a mass Shh-In at the Central Library, Surrey Street.

Rules (esprcially for anarchists)
1. Finger to lips
2. At 11am say Shhhhh!
3. Finish off with three cheers for the library!
4. Finally borrow lots of books - lets empty those shelves. You are allowed up to 15 out on your library card.
