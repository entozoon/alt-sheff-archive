		<td>Yes! Campaign for Fairer Votes are having a public presence in four different places on Saturday: leafleting and talking to the public about the referendum on the Alternative Votes coming on 5th April and the campaign to vote 'Yes' to AV. This will help to elect more accountable MPs via a more inclusive system so that MPs have the support of the majority of their constituents, reducing the likelihood of extremists being elected, ending tactical voting
