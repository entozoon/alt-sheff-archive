		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The campaign against "fracking" is growing, as test drilling starts in South Yorkshire. The process is associated with increased global warming, earthquakes, air pollution from leaking toxic and carcinogenic vapours, and reports of high rates of cancer, breathing difficulties, neurological and reproductive problems, nausea, dizziness and in some cases death.

All welcome to the meeting. The website (below) has an excellent series of leaflets to download with information about fracking, which you will not easily find in the mainstream media because there is a lot of corrupt corporate money behind this.
