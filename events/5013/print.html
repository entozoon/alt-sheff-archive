		<td>Book your tickets for the ASSIST big event of the year! The 2017 Fundraising Dinner is at a new venue with new caterers, The Real Junk Food Project. Once again it celebrates Refugee Week and the work of ASSIST, but because Refugee Week falls during Ramadan this year it is a slightly later date.

The evening will include a three course meal served at your table with meat, vegetarian and vegan options, bar, last chance to place a bid for some of the amazing promises in the Auction of Promises, which will be run online, and other fun and games. It is an opportunity to meet other ASSIST supporters and, if you are new to ASSIST, find out more about the work supporting destitute asylum seekers in Sheffield.

Tickets are Â£25 each and can be purchased online from <a href="http://www.assistdinner2017.eventbrite.co.uk/">assistdinner2017.eventbrite.co.uk</a> (where a booking fee will be charged) or from the ASSIST office, (pay by cheque, please phone ahead on Sheff 2754960 to check it is open). Get your tickets ASAP, places are limited. Doors open at 6:30pm, Dinner served at 7:30pm
