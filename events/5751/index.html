The overall theme of the Northern site will be &#39;Northern Forest,&#39; and for this the plan is to re-wild a patch of London with three main concept-pieces: The Beehive, The Forest and The Nest.What would the wild be without its wildlife? The two costume themes will be &#39;The Birds and the Bees&#39; and &#39;Northern Forest&#39; Let us flex our creative Northern muscles and get as many of our rebels striped, spotted, feathered and furred as possible. Additionally any props, banners, decorations, placards and artwork that you can beg, borrow, steal, or rustle up to fit with this theme will help to make our forest a thriving hub of biodiversity, with the potential to put a smile on the face of even the most sour-faced dawn commuter.If you don&#39;t want to design your own costume, please contact  (xrworldsnorth@gmail.com) for one of the 7 giant origami animal-heads (available as pdf downloads to print at home - badgers, foxes, wolves, bears and more. If you would like to arrange local workshops or get togethers to make lots, that would be even better! They may take a bit of time to assemble, but the final result will be well worth it.<strong>Police Liaison</strong>XR Sheffield need to organise a rota of people to cover the entire 2 weeks on a shift basis. No previous experience necessary, but there is some training available in Manchester weekend 29th Sept but is not mandatory as we can pass on briefing details to them.If you can help, please contact Jo Murphey via Basecamp, text 07986 949250, Signal, or email <a href=_mailto_info%40jomurphypilates.co.html>info@jomurphypilates.co.uk</a>.<strong> Get yourself sorted for Rebellion</strong>    Buy coach tickets to London. For rebels with disabilities there are subsidised rail transport.    All Affinity groups, please appoint a Sustenance Rep responsible for thinking about food, what equipment you need to take, and food supplies you can collect for our donation tables (vegan preferred).    Join an affinity group for going to London to take direct action.<strong>Come meet Extinction Rebellion Sheffield</strong> for food and conversation at weekly meetings on Mondays (23rd & 30th September), 6pm at Union St. cafe.
