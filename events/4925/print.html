The popular Free Radicals play a benefit gig of soul, salsa and classic dance for Bartolina Sisa. This indigenous women’s empowerment group operates across Bolivia, which is leading a ‘process of change’ to reverse centuries of colonialism, racism, dictatorship and poverty, under its first indigenous president, Evo Morales. Its 2009 constitution commits to equality in a male-dominated society, and a new level of care for the environment. A Sheffield group is working in solidarity, bringing much-needed funds because the country is very poor. 

Put on your dancing shoes! Salsa lesson included from 8pm-9pm. Invite your friends to come and have a party! £8/£4 concessions on the door.</td>
