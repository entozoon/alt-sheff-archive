		<td>Abundance is a project to harvest the seasonal glut of local fruit like apples, pear and plums. Loads of fruit trees go unpicked either because people can't harvest them or don't notice them. Abundance volunteers redistribute city fruit for the community on a non-profit basis - to community cafes, nurseries, Surestarts and individuals. They have also juiced tonnes of fruit and made jams, chutneys and preserves.Why not get in touch:<ul><li>If you have a fruit tree and want help with harvesting. You will get the first share.</li><li>If you are interested in becoming an urban harvester or want to help with picking, distribution or processing. Volunteers have the pleasure of eating fresh, ripe fruit from the tree, finding out more about urban food growing and working alongside enthusiastic people of all ages. </li><li>If you would like to receive fresh fruit for your group or neighbourhood.</li></ul>
