		<td>In 2016, <strong>Volvo</strong> launched their ‘Human Made’ advertising campaign. And Sam got sort of obsessed. He got so obsessed he decided to make some adverts of his own and produced this show. It‘s about desire, the things we want and the things we‘ll do to get them with live music and video artistry, and the award-winning YESYESNONO. A smart, heart-breaking and fevered excavation of adverts, objects and longing. Presumably not sponsored by Volvo.

You can stay after the show for an audio-visual club night experience with big tunes, big video, big things.
