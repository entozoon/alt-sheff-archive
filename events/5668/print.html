		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A petition with over 10,000 signatures calls on the Council to recognise State of Palestine. It will be presented to Julie Dore, Leader of Sheffield City Council, in line with a cross-party motion passed in the UK Parliament in 2014 and UN official designation since 1988.

The size of the petition is unprecedented and demonstrates the wish of ordinary citizens to see justice for Palestinians, who have suffered dispossession of their homes, Israeli military occupation, human rights abuse and siege over the decades since 1948.

Whilst largely symbolic, Sheffieldâ€™s recognition of the Palestinian right to statehood would be significant. The UK government has always taken a timid approach under United States pressure, but many feel that the tide of public opinion is turning. <strong>Sheffield City Council would be the first UK council to take this step and set a precedent, just as happened with its recognition of Somaliland as an independent state, which other councils followed. Sheffield has a strong tradition of supporting international campaigns for justice, such as the anti-apartheid movement.</strong>

Before the meeting of full Council, speakers will address a rally at 1pm outside the Town Hall, and the Palestinian flag will be raised. Councillor Julie Dore will be invited to receive the petition.
