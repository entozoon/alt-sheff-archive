		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Oscar nominated director Josh Fox (‘Gasland’) continues in his deeply personal style, investigating climate change – the greatest threat our world has ever known. The film acknowledges that it may be too late to stop some of the worst consequences and asks, what is it that climate change can’t destroy? What is so deep within us that no calamity can take it away? Sheffield Climate Alliance partners with Regather Co-Op for a <a href="http://www.festivalofdebate.com/">Festival of Debate</a> film screening with discussion. 

Hosted by not-for-profit social enterprise <a href="http://www.opusindependents.com/">Opus Independents</a> (which also publishes the Alt-Sheff "Localcheck" column in <a href="http://nowthenmagazine.com/sheffield/">"Now Then"</a> magazine). 

Tickets £7, profits from the event will be donated to Sheffield Climate Alliance for local campaigning. Booking link <a href="https://regather.net/event/let-go-world-qa-festival-debate/">here</a>.</td>
