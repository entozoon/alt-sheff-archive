		<td>By now virtually everyone in the country must be acquainted with the horrific details of the child sex abuse in Rotherham. The story of child abuse, corrupt authorities and blind eyes turned to the exploitation of young working class girls, making them effectively disposable people, has much in common with the other child abuse scandals that have enraged us all. Jimmy Saville and Cyril Smith profited from a similar disregard for lives not important to the establishment.

The far-right have swarmed on this issue solely to push their own divisive and racist agenda. For all the crocodile tears shed for the children of Rotherham they remain silent on all child abuse unless it involves Muslims. Where are the EDL’s demands for white men of Christian background to put their collective house in order? They are silent on that subject and perhaps they are wise to be because lurking in their ranks are an assembly of groomers and sex offenders.

The truth is this:

- We live in a patriarchal society in which sexual abuse is rife amongst people of all backgrounds. Male power and male sexuality in our society are deeply problematic.

- We live in a class society in which working class lives are not seen as valuable – The police and councils don’t care about working class kids from care homes.

- We live in a racist society in which people who are not white are not seen as individuals but are held to be collectively responsible for the actions of their ‘community’.

- We stand against all injustice and all oppression based on class, race or gender.

Leeds Anti-Fascist Network will be demonstrating in Rotherham both to highlight the sexism and class-prejudice that perpetuates the abuse of working class girls, in Rotherham and elsewhere, and against the racist response to these events that lets the real culprits off the hook. Join in supporting this call out for an anti-sexist, anti-racist response to the far right’s organising in Rotherham.
