		<td>Got computer problems? BitFixIT Caf√© is a free computer-fixing workshop. Simply come along and get your computer problems sorted out then and there. Or they can tell you exactly what to get and then fit it for you. If you need software, they will find you genuinely free, legal programs and help you install and configure them. And if you had a bad case of virus attack, they can nurse your computer back to health - and give you the tools and training you need to keep it virus-free in future. 

Sounds too good to be true? BitFixIT is a group of volunteers who enjoy mending computers and think it is good for the community too. A working PC and internet connection - and a bit of good advice - can help people to stay in touch, know their rights, learn, work, create and be entertained. Computers are important! People need them.
