		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Martin Poulter speaks about Scientology, described in the States as “ruthless, litigious and lucrative” and in this country as “corrupt, sinister and dangerous”, yet boasting global success. Thanks to the Internet, it now faces an unprecedented global opposition. The scary secrets of Scientology and its recruitment methods will be exposed in this talk. Martin Poulter has a Philosophy and Psychology degree from Oxford University and a PhD in Philosophy of Science from the University of Bristol. He has been a Scientology-watcher since 1995, when he was threatened with legal action over material he posted online. 

Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. The events are free though they ask for a £3 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
