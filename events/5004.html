	<p class="message">This is a five day theatre and arts festival held during Refugee Week. Its aim is to celebrate diversity and recognise the positive impact migration has on the city. It brings together people, talks, exhibitions and performers from many communities, and welcomes you to come and show Sheffield is a friendly and supportive city. Many people who aren&#39;t familiar with the injustices of the asylum system say how important this festival is.Performance highlights this year include &#39;An Evening with an Immigrant&#39;, by Nigerian-born Inua Ellams, and the new play &#39;Borderline&#39;, by PSYCHEdelight. Musical treats from Syria, Southern Africa, Congo, and much more. It will be one of the final seasons based in the current home of Theatre Delicatessen, 17 The Moor, S1 3LR, before it moves out to allow for redevelopment of the old Woolworths shop.<strong>Tuesday 20th June:	</strong>							Moma K Launch Night	(Exhibition opening) 7.00pm-10.00pm at DINASunrit Culture Group - Bahukon (Dance) 7.00pm-8.00pm at Theatre DeliSosa Xa - No performance name (Music) 8.00pm-8.30pmat Theatre DeliOne Way Belongings Dance (Dance) 8.30pm-9.00pm at Theatre DeliSosa Xa - No performance name (Music) 9.00pm-9.30pmat Theatre DeliOpen Kitchen Social Club (Food) 9.30pm-10.30pm at Theatre DeliRafiki Jazz (band) (Music) 10.00pm-11.00pm at Theatre Deli								<strong>Wednesday 21st June:		</strong>						Why Refugee Women Fashion Show (Fashion) 11.30am-1.30pmat Theatre DeliScatterlings - All over Everything (Dance) 1.00pm-1.45pm at	Tudor SquareAngelina Abel (Workshop) 2.00pm-3.30pm at Tudor SquareInComplete Collaboration - Indefinite Leave to Remain (Theatre) 3.00pm-4.00pm at Theatre DeliNisha Lall - Rise (Dance) 4.00pm-4.30pm at	Tudor SquareDEWA Workshop - Women and Peace (Workshop) 4.30pm-5.30pma at The ArthouseLucy Haighton - Ruido (Performance) 5.00pm-5:40pm at Theatre DeliEvi Stamatiou - Caryatid Unplugged (Theatre) 5.30pm-6.30pm at DINAValerie Monti Holland - Forum Theatre (Workshop) 6.00pm-7.00pm at Theatre DeliRefugee Tales (Literature) 6.45pm-7.45pm at DINAInua Ellams - An Evening with an Immigrant (Theatre) 8.00pm-9.30pmat Theatre Deli								<strong>Thursday 22nd June:</strong>								Together Women - Fusion Group Celebration (Celebration) 11.00am-2.00pm at Theatre DeliRight to Remain Workshop (Workshop) 3.00pm-5.00pm at Theatre DeliConversation Club - Folktales around the world (Performance) 5.00pm-6.30pm at The ArthouseHowl Yuan - How can I stay legally in the UK (Theatre) 5.00pm-5.45pm at Theatre DeliMengting Zhuo - Before the Wall (Theatre) 6.30pm-7:15pm at Theatre DeliE-Merges - Performance Night (Music/Live Art) 7.00pm-10.00pm at DINAVerse Matters (Poetry/Spoken Word) 7.30pm-10.00pm at Theatre Deli								<strong>Friday 23rd June:			</strong>					Anima Artworks (Workshop) 10.30am-1.00pm at Theatre DeliBritish Red Cross - Refugee Awareness Workshop (Workshop) 12.00pm-2.00pm at Theatre DeliEl-Addo Sewing Workshops (Workshop) 1.30pm-2.30pmat Theatre Deli (cafe)Afreena Islam - Daughters of the Curry Revolution (Theatre) 4.00pm-4.45pmat Theatre DeliDEWA Workshop - Talk that Talk (Workshop) 4.30pm-5.30pmat The Adelphi RoomVertebra Arts - An Ice thing to say (Theatre) 5.00pm-5:40pm at Theatre DeliAfreena Islam - Daughters of the Curry Revolution (Theatre) 6.00pm-6.45pmat Theatre DeliVertebra Arts - An Ice thing to say (Theatre) 7.00pm-7:40pm at Theatre DeliStand and Be Counted Theatre - Tanja (Theatre) 7.30pm-8.30pm at	The MontgomeryAfreena Islam - Daughters of the Curry Revolution (Theatre) 8.00pm-8.45pm at Theatre DeliBeats, Bass & (No) Borders (Music Night) 8.00pm-2:00 AM at DINA								<strong>Saturday 24th June:</strong>								Stand and Be Counted Theatre - Performance Migrations (Workshop) 10.30am-11.20am at Theatre Deli - Main SpaceAnima Artworks Workshops (Workshop) 11.30am-1.30pm at Theatre DeliEl-Addo Sewing Workshops (Workshop) 11.30am-12.30pm at Theatre Deli (cafe)Third Angel (Theatre) 12.00pm-7.30pmat Theatre Deli - WarehouseHowl Yuan - 100 ways to say goodbye (Theatre) 12.00pm-1.30pm		Sheaf SquareUmoja Dance Group (Dance) 1.30pm-1:50 AMat Theatre DeliOtoxo Productions- El Peso De La Menta (Film) 2.00pm-2.35pm at Theatre DeliElement Society - Open Mic performance (Various) 3.00pm-6.30pm at The MontgomeryThe Paper Project - We are not Birds (Theatre) 3.00pm-3.40pm at Theatre DeliSunrit Culture Group - Bahukon (Dance) 4.00pm-4.30pmat Theatre DeliIce & Fire - The Asylum Monologues (Theatre) 4.00pm-4.45pm at The ArthouseInComplete Collaboration - Utopia (Theatre) 4.30pm-5.30pm at Theatre DeliThe Paper Project - We are not Birds (Theatre) 6.00pm-6.40pm at Theatre DeliPsychedelight - Borderline (Theatre) 8.30pm-9.30pm at Theatre DeliOpen Kitchen Social Club (Food) 9.30pm-10.30pm at Theatre DeliMulembas DÂ´Africa dance group (Dance) 10.00pm-10.30pm at Theatre DeliMortal Tides (Band) (Music) 10.30pm-11.30pm at Theatre DeliMango Rescue Team (Music) 11.30pm-12:20am at Theatre DeliMango Disco Addis Abbaba Sound System (Music) 12.30pm-2.30am at Theatre Deli																<strong>Exhibitions:	</strong>							Moma K		20-30th June		11.00am-5.00pm at DINAI Welcome Refugee		20-24th June		11.00am-4.00pm at The ArthouseJessica Omitola		20-24th June		11.00am-4.00pm at Theatre Delicatessen								<strong>Installations:	</strong>Karmand Tahssin (Live Art)		20-24th June		11.00am-4.00pm at Theatre DelicatessenThe Bare Project		21st-24th June		13.00pm-15.00pm at Theatre Delicatessen<a href="http://www.migrationmattersfestival.co.uk/">Migration Matters Festival</a></p>
