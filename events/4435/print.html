		<td>Nether Edge Farmers Market is less consumerist and more charity-oriented than most. It is more than a market, with and time to sit and chat, live entertainment, music, drama, activities and workshops (usually including activities for young people on Nether Edge Bowling Green).

It takes place every quarter in the streets around Glen Road and the old Nether Edge Market Place, ('Nether Edge crossroads' between Nether Edge Road/Moncrieffe Road and Sheldon Road/Machon Bank Road).
