		<td>Join <i>Road Rage!</i> for an evening of rebellious rabble-rousing and find out how people are resisting the Tories latest plans to tarmac the countryside. Benefit gig in aid of direct action against new roads in the UK, with a host of treats to tempt you along ...

A chunky slice of Sheffield music to while away the night to, including:

<b>SIGRID & THE FAMILY BAND</b>
Growling, sparkling, tumbling blues songs from this particularly fine set of musical siblings.

<b>ROWAN RHEINGANS</b>
Flowing fiddle sounds and perhaps the odd banjo twang too from one of this town&#39;s most especially wonderful singers. 

<b>AL BAKER</b>
Songs and ideas carefully-melded and freshly-delivered to give your mind a healthy shake up. 

<b>OWLY AL</b>
Penetrating, mellifluous, passionate sounds and stories from a welcome visitor to Sheffield.

Plus several more besides. Also a dinner&#39;s-worth of beautiful, animal-friendly (or vegan, if you like) <b>FOOD</b> will be laid on, so no need to eat before you come! 

And most excitingly, an extra-special <b>ROAD RAGE! RAFFLE, </b>your chance to give a little bit of financial support to the protection of the earth AND win a snazzy prize at the same time. 

£5/£3 (low/unwaged).
