		<td>We face a vicious government who prioritise only the richest in society, big business and the corporations. With the potential of 4 more years dismantling the NHS, furthering the housing crisis, taking away workers’ rights, and attacking our education system – it’s time to get back on the streets and to demonstrate that the majority won’t take it. The Tories aren’t going to back down easily so it’s up to each and every one of us to get out and march for our Health, Homes, Jobs and Education. 

Last year saw massive political shifts. After the devastating general election result, where the Tories gained a tiny majority, it became clear that that result did not reflect the views of the county. Immediately after the election, protests, meetings, rallies and demonstrations took place up and down the country culminating in one of the biggest demonstrations in Britain for years with 250,000 people bringing London to a stand still on the End Austerity Now Demonstration organised by the People’s Assembly. Since then, the surge in support for anti-austerity politics, being put forward by Jeremy Corbyn, is yet another indication that people are fed up with policies that only represent those at the top.

Transport is being arranged from across the country, full details including route and speakers will be announced soon.
