		<td>Following worries about asylum seekers being asked <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/asylum-seekers-home-office-zimbabwe-immigration-embassy-political-persecution-africa-a8675571.html">‘distressing’ questions</a> by a Zimbabwean Embassy official invited to Sheffield by the Home Office to interrogate them in December, the worst fears may now be realised. <strong>Two Zimbabwean nationals, who have lived in Britain for years, have been detained and are threatened with deportation to Zimbabwe. 

Victor Mujakachi</strong> and <strong>Khozani Ndvolu</strong> were held when they went to Vulcan House, the Home Office building in Sheffield, for an ‘interview’ on Monday 11th February. Several other Zimbabweans have been asked to attend Vulcan House over the next week, so fears are also high for their safety.

Zimbabwean asylum seekers have called for these protests, and support when they go to Vulcan House. The government cannot deport Zimbabweans at a time of political violence, especially  well-known and well-liked community activists. The new Zimbabwean government of Emerson Mnangagwa seems to be as repressive as Robert Mugabe’s. Our asylum system should give protection to those who need it, not hand them over to torture or death.

Please sign the petition to release Victor Mujakachi from detention at <a href="https://www.change.org/p/home-office-free-victor-mujakachi">Change.org</a>
