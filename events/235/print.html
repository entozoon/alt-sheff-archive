		<td>Want an opportunity to help shape the future of Sheffield? Sheffield First Partnership is working in the next City Strategy, which will set out the cityâ€™s ambitions and how these will be achieved over the next five years. Actually a really important document because all the statutory agencies are supposed to ensure it influences their plans, and also it is often used in negotiations with national Government.
 
Sheffield First want to ensure that local people are engaged in developing the strategy & are keen to hear your suggestions.
