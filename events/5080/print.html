N.E.C Neepsend Club is a collective of antifascist activists, artists and musicians based in Sheffield. Their goal is to halt gentrification in an area that has amazing potential to be an alternative haven. They are squatting in a beautiful semi-abandoned industrial estate, surrounded by a sea of beautiful empty buildings, which is slowly being turned into soulless student flats and hipster cafes. They aim to make this space into a community centre for gigs, art sessions and political talks. They are left anarchists and want to get as many people on board as possible, so they welcome input from anyone wanting to get involved.
<strong>
N.E.C Mission Statement: At a time when homelessness, authoritarian violence and right-wing politics are ravaging not just our nation but our entire planet, organised and positive action is a necessity. We are part of the community of Neepsend. Some of us have lived round here for life. We have slowly watched our home go from being a solid working class area to an alien hostile environment. Just because we are poor the Council and heartless landlords seem to think the destruction of our identity is OK. Enough is enough. Our time for organised and positive action is now.
