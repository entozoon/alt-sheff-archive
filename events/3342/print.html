		<td>The April boycott action by Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign is at Church Street Sainsbury, in oppostion to trading with suppliers on occupied Palestinian territories. The day of action in March saw 34 groups across the country doing boycott actions and in Sheffield an organised motorcade visited five Sainsburys branches. Help to keep up the pressure, come and join in the April action.

Meet outside the Sainsburys on the High Street (where Blacks used to be - opposite Boots). There is usually lots of people around to talk with and ask to sign the petition. They will also finish by walking with banners and placards up through Fargate to let the Sainsburys on Division Street know they have not been forgotten!
