		<td>Politics professor Andrew Gamble will be the headline speaker at the next Independent Labour Publications (ILP) day school on ‘The future of progressive politics’ to be held in Sheffield.

Professor of Politics at the University of Sheffield and Emeritus Professor of Politics at the University of Cambridge, he will speak about his new book ‘Open Left: The Future of Progressive Politics‘, and his ideas on how to create a social democracy for the 21st century.

In his book, he says:<i> “The ten years since the financial crash have been lean years for progressive politics of all kinds. Now Brexit in the UK, Trump in the US, and the rising tide of national populism in Europe pose new dangers. Parties of the Centre-Left are in retreat. Old bases of support have declined, old policies are out of touch, old assumptions no longer hold.

    “At the same time new thinking, new innovations, new forces are turning the world upside down. We face great dangers but also great opportunities.

    “How should those who still want a progressive future respond? This book argues that the first priority is an Open Left. We must abandon the idea that one tradition of progressive thought has all the answers. We need openness to new policy ideas, openness to learning from past mistakes and others’ experiences. We should be prepared to listen to very different voices and very different intellectual traditions. We must find ways to engage with people from a wide range of communities and backgrounds.

    “An Open Left also recognises we cannot retreat from the world, or ignore economic and political realities. We need a dialogue with progressive movements from many different countries, learning from their experiences of putting progressive ideas into action.

    “The idea of progress can still inspire change, but it needs updating.” </i>

The talk will be followed by the ILP’s Barry Winter who will lead a discussion on ‘taking back control’ and whether the slogan adopted by many Brexit supporters can be used for progressive purposes.
