		<td>Global Justice aims to change the actions, policies and institutions of governments, corporations and wealthy minorities, which are preventing an end to poverty and injustice. The organising meeting is held on the first Thursday of each month, to discuss coming events and campaigns. 

News from Global Justice includes research showing that Africa subsidises the rest of the world by $40 billion per year, Ecuador has ripped up 16 toxic trade treaties, rising UK drug prices are more than twice the entire NHS deficit, and that the government is trying to rush a bill through parliament to divert billions in aid money towards private investment, away from poverty alleviation.
