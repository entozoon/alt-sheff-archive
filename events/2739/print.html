		<td>In Britain and many other countries there is a tremendous growth of feminist activism. In the past, during the Second Wave Women&#39;s Movement for instance, marxist ideas played an important role in describing and shaping the politics of women&#39;s liberation. Not so much today. It is time to renew the link. Part one of a &#39;Marxism & Feminism&#39; series of meetings, hosted by Alliance for Workers Liberty.
