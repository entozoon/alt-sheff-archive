		<td>John Smith and Steve Ludlam of Sheffield Cuba Solidarity Campaign will talk through key moments in Cuban history through its money.  Find out what Che Guevara’s role was in selling off Cuba’s gold reserves and getting rid of the banks. Why were US dollars prohibited, legalised, then swept out of circulation overnight? Why does Cuba have two different currencies? A quirky look at Cuba from a completely different angle.</td>
