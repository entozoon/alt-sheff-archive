		<td>Sheffield has a rich and vibrant history of activism. The ‘Stories of Activism in Sheffield, 1960-present’ project has been conducting interviews with activists from around the city. The city centre and its immediate surrounding areas are an important part of their stories. Join poet River Wolton, Dr Adrian Bingham and others to trace the City’s activist past and present through its buildings, landmarks and streets. The stories will bring to life again—and update—the famous ‘Radical History Walk’. 

All participants are invited to add their stories and contribute to the project’s growing collection stored at Sheffield Archives. This walk is repeated on 22nd of May at 6-8pm. Tickets are free and can be booked at the website below.
