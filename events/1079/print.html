		<td>The next meeting of the Equality Group. All are welcome. Sheffield Equality Group meetings aim to be an open and inclusive space for discussion and action to address issues of income inequality. 

The first part of the meeting will, depending on what people want to discuss on the night, talk around issues raised at the Your Money and Your Life meeting on health inequalities, the spending review and measures of wellbeing. Also: report back from the national Equality Trust conference; plans for a public meeting on tax; and more! 

The health meeting on the 21st Oct. was a great success, thanks to all who helped and attended. Presentation slides, audio and discussion are linked from the website along with a summary of the meeting: <a href="http://wp.me/p124sa-2B">http://wp.me/p124sa-2B</a>
