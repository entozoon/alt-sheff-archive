		<td>Shahd was the youngest to travel with the Al Asria dancers back in 2005, she is an artist and MA student. Being a daughter of a former Palestinian prisoner who spent 15 years in Israel’s prisons has been the primary source of inspiration for her work fighting the ongoing injustice that faces her people every day. Her blog, Palestine from my eyes, is an evocative expression of how important art and culture are in mobilising resistance. 

Join Sheffield Palestine Solidarity to hear Shahd and have some delicious Palestinian food. Tickets £7 - £10.
