		<td>Climate change is a global justice issue at heart. Social and environmental issues are always deeply connected, and the same structures that devastate the environment also perpetuate racial inequalities. Communities in the Global South, indigenous groups and poorer communities, often consisting of people of colour, suffer the economic and social impacts of climate change disproportionately. Yet their voices are often silenced or relegated to footnotes, while voices from white and privileged backgrounds dominate the environmental movement. So, how exactly is climate change connected to race, and why canâ€™t it be separated from issues such as migration and social inequality? 

Join a panel of experts to discuss, including:
<strong>Judy Ling Wong </strong>CBE OBE, painter, poet and environmentalist, of the Black Environment Network.
<strong>Asad Rehman</strong>, War on Want, previously Head of International Climate at Friends of the Earth
<strong>Angela Chan</strong>, founder of Worm, a creative platform that focuses on decolonial climate and social justice work in solidarity and with queer, trans, Indigenous, Black and People of colour. 
<strong>Natasha Mumbi Nkonde</strong>, Edge Fund, Black Lives Matter UK and End Deportations. 

Part of Festival of Debate 2019 in association with University of Sheffield Sustainability Committee, sponsored by Sheffield Climate Alliance and Regather.
