		<td>This facilitated conversation offers an opportunity to get underneath the issues to some of the feelings that moved us in the EU referendum and that still matter, and to have some of the encounters and conversations that have been missing. An opportunity for us, in Sheffield, to talk and explore together, to get curious about one anotherâ€™s experience and motives with a view to understanding who we are and what matters to us.
