		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Countless sick and Disabled People have died as a result of undergoing Atos’ Work Capability Assessments. The Assessments are degrading and are used to stop people getting benefits. The majority who appeal Atos decisions win their claims. This takes a long time and damages people’s health. While people wait for their appeal, their benefits are stopped. The ConDem government is trying to turn the clock back to Victorian times. They want people to believe that we are all “scroungers.” What we need is an end to discrimination when looking for work or somewhere to live and health and social care services that meet our needs. 

The Work Capability Assessment is one of many attacks on people on benefits which cause hardship and misery. We must organise to defeat these attacks. DPAC works with public sector trade unions and community groups to stop these attacks. Sheffield DPAC demands that the ConDem Government:

    Immediately withdraws all contracts from Atos without compensation.
    Scraps the Work Capability Assessment
    Scraps the wasteful and punitive Work Programme which pays millions to private companies.
    Stops unpaid work for benefit claimants – if work needs doing, people should be paid a living wages for doing it. Unpaid work takes away work from workers and undermines wages.
    Ends the Bedroom Tax and reverses public service and other benefit cuts.

Benefit claimants did not cause the financial crisis or the public spending deficit. Why should the poorest people pay for it?
