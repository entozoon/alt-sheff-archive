		<td>The first Transition Cafe will be a chance for all those involved in or interested in the Transition Town movement to meet others, find out what's been going on in Sheffield, and make plans for the future. Transition Sheffield runs community-led projects in response to climate change and the end of cheap energy. If you're interested in the future sustainability of Sheffield and South Yorkshire, come for a night of drinks and discussion. 

There will be drinks and cakes available and the evening will include an hour of Open Space discussion. Please bring any questions or ideas you have for Transition in Sheffield. It would be great to get new people involved in Transition, so please invite your friends and family along.
