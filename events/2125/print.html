		<td>The Sheffield Esteli Two Peaks sponsored bike ride raises money for educational and environmental projects in Esteli, Sheffield&#39;s twin town in Nicaragua. Support and sponsorship is vital, this is one of the poorest countries in the world and with one of the largest gaps between rich and poor. 

The ride starts between 8am and 9am from Endcliffe Park, 2 miles south-west of Sheffield city centre, off Rustlings Road S11 7AB. For full details tel. Sheff 2555550 or email <a href="mailto:sheffieldestelisociety@yahoo.co.uk">sheffieldestelisociety@yahoo.co.uk</a>
