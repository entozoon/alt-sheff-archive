		<td>Owen Jones talks about his book Chavs, which opens up a major debate about the stereotyping of the working class in Britain and exposes the ignorance and prejudice at the heart of the chav caricature, one based on the media&#39;s inexhaustible obsession with an indigent white underclass. His acclaimed book portrays a far more complex reality.

Owen is a writer, commentator and activist. He is a columnist with The Independent and has worked in Parliament as a trade union lobbyist and parliamentary researcher, helping Labour plan backbench rebellions on issues ranging from civil liberties to workers&#39; rights.

Part of <b>Off the Shelf</b>, Sheffield&#39;s 21-year old annual festival of words, with a great programme of over 200 events this year. Between 13th October and 3rd November 2012, there is everything from community events to readings to workshops, at various venues. Tickets £7.50/£5.50 concessions
