		<th>Details</th>
		<td>An event asking about fair votes, where power should lie, and how citizens can hold it accountable. With questions being raised about how to determine and reflect ‘the will of the people’, what should a modern democratic system look like? And what role should that most basic of all democratic building blocks, proportional voting, play?

Chaired by Vicky Seddon, co-ordinator of Sheffield for Democracy, assisted by Nigel Slack, Cllr Shaffaq Mohammed, Cllr Jack Scott, and academic Chris Kirkland, who has research interests in crises and change in modern British politics.

"Sheffield for Democracy" is hosting this event, with the support of "Make Votes Matter". All welcome.</td>
