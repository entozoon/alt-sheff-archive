		<td>An exhibition as part of Bank Street Arts celebration of Student Artists, Occupation: Free Art Space for Free Education. To highlight the importance of their influence on our city, Bank Street Arts is offering free access to its Project Spaces for students to create, exhibit or otherwise occupy.

Street photographer Tom Archer presents two projects:

Eye to Eye: Exploring themes of spectatorship, voyeurism, and intrusion that capture exploitative and intimate moments of interaction between the subject and camera.

Nothing New: An evolving slideshow of photographs, updated regularly throughout the fortnight, capturing strange non-moments of life, mostly taken in suburban areas of Sheffield.</td>
