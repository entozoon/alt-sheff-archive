		<td>Training for anti-frackers run by Seeds for Change, supported by Reclaim The Power (RTP), open to members of all anti-fracking groups and like-minded individuals. Organised by FrAcktion, a group who have set themselves up to organise a spring anti-fracking event in the South Yorks/Notts/Derbys/Lincoln area with RTP. 

The workshop, for 8-18 people, will cover creative action planning, your legal rights, direct action and campaign security. There will be other workshops planned in the next couple of months including Facilitation, Effective Groups, Action Planning, and others.

Note the venue is south-east from Sheffield, on the border with Nottinghamshire, near potential fracking sites. Free but donations to cover costs would be appreciated.
