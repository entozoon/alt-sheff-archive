		<td>With Sheffield facing closures of everything from playgrounds to libraries, along with Stocksbridge Leisure Centre, and huge redundancies, pay freezes and benefits cuts, now is the time to react and get out in the streets. Areas in the more prosperous south-east are being far less affected, and anyway why should the people pay for the financiers&#39; "crisis"? It&#39;s just an excuse for the same old policies of fleecing people.

Demo organised by Sheffield Anti-Cuts Alliance and various unions.</td>
