		<td>Help raise the Palestinian flag over Mam Tor!

The struggle for the people&#39;s ‘Right to Roam’ across the land took years of protest, including locally the historic Kinder Trespass. Today the freedoms gained would be a distant dream to millions in Palestine living under severe restrictions of movement. In particular the narrow 26 mile Gaza Strip holds 1.8 million people subject to attacks, siege conditions and harsh restrictions on movement. This awareness-raising and fund-raising walk has been in action since May, and goes on to Scotland next year. This is the final ‘England’ section from Bristol to Edale. The walkers left Bristol on 12 September, planning to arrive via the south Pennines into Edale today. Please join, with as many friends and supporters as possible, to raise the Palestinian flag over Mam Tor around midday before they walk down to the cafe in Edale Village as the finale of the ‘England’ section of the walk. 

Donations gratefully received, funds are being raised for two projects in Gaza: Sheffield Palestine Women’s Scholarship Fund And Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign’s Children’s Projects in the refugee camps in Gaza. 

Edale is accessible by train from Sheffield. Mam Tor is a hill close to nearby Castleton.
