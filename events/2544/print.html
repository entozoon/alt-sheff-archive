This conference will bring together City of Sanctuary workers and volunteers with agencies and individuals working within and outside the refugee sector to answer key questions like “Who are City of Sanctuary Sheffield?”, “What does CoSS do?” and “How can I get involved/what can I do?” And to consider the current challenges facing asylum seekers and plan a way ahead for the future. 

9.30am for 10am (prompt start) till 1pm including lunch. Opening speech by City Council Cabinet Member for Communities and Inclusion, Councillor Mazher Iqbal. To book a place email <a href="mailto:admin@sheffield.cityofsanctuary.org">admin@sheffield.cityofsanctuary.org</a>
