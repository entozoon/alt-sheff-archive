		<td>Planning for more wonder and celebrating the awesomeness of life - first "Sunday Assembly" Sheffield organising meeting.

The Sunday Assembly is a godless congregation that meets to hear great talks, sing songs and generally celebrate the wonder of life. Itâ€™s a service for anyone who wants to live better, help often and wonder more, and it has all the best bits about church, except with no religion, and cracking pop tunes.

Since launching in London in January this year, the Sunday Assembly has become a global movement, a community of communities. All welcome to this planning meeting for the Sheffield launch.
