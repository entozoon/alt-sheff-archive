		<td>Please join a solidarity protest outside Sheffield Town Hall called as the Palestinians face more Israeli onslaught in the wake of the killing of three Israeli settlers. Warplanes continue the bombing of Gaza and bulldozers demolish houses in the West Bank, as Mohamed Abu Khdeir, 16, becomes a victim of the call for revenge by Israelis. 

The protest has been called by Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign and is supported by Sheffield Stop the War Coalition.</td>
