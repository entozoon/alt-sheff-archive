		<td>Sheffield Palestinian Solidarity Campaign will be starting the year as they mean to go on, with this boycott demonstration. It reminds Sainsburys that continuing to trade with companies working in the illegal Israel settlements not only supports the occupation and the continuing death toll of Palestinians, but also the devastation of Palestinian agriculture. It is the time of the January sales so there will a lot of people out on the Moor and an opportunity to put the case to them.
