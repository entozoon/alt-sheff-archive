		<td>ACORN Sheffield host a public conversation about the local impact of a national housing crisis and the ambitious ideas that could revolutionise housing in Sheffield. ACORN are campaigning to hold rogue landlords who profit from unsafe housing to account. Panel featuring Councillor Jim Steinke, decision makers, campaigners and tenants. 

The Sheffield Labour party local election manifesto contains no commitment to bring in the citywide licensing that tenants in Sheffield so desperately need. This a final chance before the local elections on May 2nd to get a real commitment to protect tenants. Councillor Steinke will have to pick a side, so ACORN need as many people there as possible to force him to side with tenants against rogue landlords. Help to hold Sheffield City Council to their responsibility to protect tenants. If you can make it, sign up and get your tickets before they run out.

This event is part of the "Our Democracy" strand of the Festival of Debate 2019, kindly sponsored by Sheffield College. Free, but please book at the link below.
