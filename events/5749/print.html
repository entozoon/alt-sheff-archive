		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Asylum seeker and refugee members of South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG) have repeatedly reported personal harassment, racism and discrimination over the past few years. Now it has been revealed that arrests of Sheffielders suspected of being “illegal immigrants” soared from double figures to around 400 a year, as Sheffield City Council is receiving money from the Government’s Controlling Migration Fund. It helps them to regulate private rented housing but also means working with the Police, HMRC and UKBA Immigration Compliance Enforcement. 

This demonstration is held as a Council committee discusses the issue. SYMAAG are demanding that the Council takes seriously being a "City of Sanctuary", and stops compliance with the Home Office over its "Hostile Environment".
