		<td>On the day of the official opening of the beautiful new South Street Park, constructed with an amphitheatre behind the railway station, a new protest is planned. East Midlands Trains, which owns the station, still hopes to close the footbridge to non-rail users, and the opposition is rallying again to oppose this. The bridge links communities on both sides of the station, the tram stop, and Sheffield Interchange, and it is particularly important for wheelchair and pushchair users as the one alternative bridge is completely inaccessible. And of course the park also needs free access across the bridge. 

Join the demonstration marching from Sheffield Hallam University at 12 noon, across the station bridge (if not stopped!) and into the new park for the early afternoon.
