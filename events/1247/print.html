		<td>A Course for the general public, introducing Organics, Permaculture and Biodynamics, in 10 two-hour sessions. Food production for the home and allotment kitchen garden.

Ideas and concepts which will explain the fundamental principles of organic food growing. These topics are relevant and useful whether you are a beginner or more experienced. Experienced grower and tutor Richard Clare believes that ornamental and amenity gardening are very different topics. We need a less militaristic and mechanistic approach to our food supply.

Over the past 10 years, more than 300 people have taken and completed one of Richard's courses in Organic Horticulture in Sheffield and Derbyshire. Many previous students have found that his courses give them the familiarity and understanding they need to pursue their growing aims and ambitions autonomously. Some have even got jobs.

Cost Â£100. To enquire or book a place: Sheff 2686727 / 07771 832759 e-mail: <a href="mailto:ediculture@gmail.com">ediculture@gmail.com</a>
