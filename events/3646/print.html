		<td>An exhibition on social inequalities in Sheffield, shown through the 83 bus route linking the north and south of our divided city. It includes filmed interviews with people who catch the 83.

Part of the the excellent <a href="http://festivalofthemind.group.shef.ac.uk/">Festival of the Mind</a>, "Fairness on the 83" is an initiative of Opus Independents, who also produce local magazine <a href="http://nowthenmagazine.com/">Now Then</a>, available online (which includes the monthly Alt-Sheff column "LocalCheck".) The current edition has <a href="http://nowthenmagazine.com/sheffield/issue-78/two-cities/">a good article about inequality</a> by Cheyanna Oâ€™Connor.

Free entry. There is an extra late evening opening until 7.30pm on Wednesday 24 September. In addition to the Castle House installation, on Friday 19 September the project will also be viewable on a bus located at the top of Fargate.
