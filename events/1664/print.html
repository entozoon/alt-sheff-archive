		<td>Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. Talks are typically about a common belief that can be demonstrated to be false or cannot be justified by the available evidence.

This time "The Singularity is Near?" with Chris Worfolk. In 1999 Ray Kurzweil published "The Singularity is Near" claiming that in 2045 artificial intelligence would surpass human intelligence and our society would enter into a period of exponential technological growth, changing the human race beyond all recognition. This would be easy to dismiss as science fiction, but Kurzweil holds 17 doctorates and was described Bill Gates as "the best man I know for predicting the future of artificial intelligence." The talk covers an introduction to the technological singularity and transhumanism, a look at Kurzweil and his predictions on the singularity, alternative theories and critics of the ideas.

Chris Worfolk graduated from the University of Leeds in 2008, having studied computer science, specialising in artificial intelligence. He is also founder of Leeds Skeptics and Leeds Atheist Society and co-founder of the Humanist Action Group and National Federation of Atheist, Humanist & Secular Student Societies.

These events are free though they ask for a Â£2 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
