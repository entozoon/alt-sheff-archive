		<td>Launch of a scheme that will try to make equality a theme across the council, in response to legislation around gender, age, ethnicity, disability, sexuality and religion. Given the importance of the gap between rich and poor for all these groups, not to mention that a socio-economic equality duty on Councils is being retained in the equality bill (<a href="http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/node/316">www.equalitytrust.org.uk/node/316</a>), you might like to have a say. The event is open to the public.
