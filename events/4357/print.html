		<td>An evening featuring two performances: Shutter Flutter and Feel Me, exploring custom-made wearable tech garments. Brought to Access Space by <a href="https://hackingthebody.wordpress.com/">Hacking the Body</a>, a project that explores the current wearable technology fervour, where users’ intimate body data is collected under the pretence of medical or fitness monitoring. The ethics of corporate ownership of body data for consumerist agendas is rarely discussed. The two pieces are the results of questioning how personal body data can demonstrate who we are as individuals. How does accessing our own data enable us to perform our identity?
