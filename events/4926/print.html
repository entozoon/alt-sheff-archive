		<td>The fifth annual Sheffield Zine Fest. A zine (pronounced ‘zeen’ like maga-zine) is a magazine or booklet that you make yourself, and give away, swap or sell for the cost of printing. What’s the point? To share your knowledge, or your feelings, or your experiences in a way that’s more tangible than blogging, less commercial, and more immediate than print media. 

The focus is usually on content, but designs, styles and print methods vary widely and can look very interesting and unusual! With short runs, some zinesters have the time to hand print covers, sew bindings, or colour in pages individually.

DIY – Do it yourself! Zines are a great way to empower yourself to create something that may seem too niche for mainstream media. If you don’t see the kind of magazine  you like on the shop shelves, why not make your own?
