The AGM will be a short meeting followed by a guest speaker around 6.30pm, and a chance to ask him questions and discuss the issues raised:  

<b>Duncan Clark</b>, journalist and co-author of <b>"The Burning Question: we can`t burn half the world`s oil coal and gas. So how do we quit?"</b>. Carbon emissions are still accelerating upwards ... tackling global warming will mean persuading the world to abandon oil, coal, and gas reserves.
