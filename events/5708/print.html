		<td>Sheffield People’s Petition has reached over 25,000 signatures. The target number is 20,092 - 5% of Sheffield voters. Clearly many Sheffielders are angry when they understand the top-down, "strong leader" model of Council governance, forced by the government in the early 2000s. It means power concentrated in the hands of too few, while the vast majority of Sheffield voters have no real voice in their Council via their elected representatives. Since 2011 councils have had the freedom to change their governance model to a modernised committee model.  Many councils have done so, in the name of better local democracy, but not Sheffield.

Everyone is welcome to gather outside the Town Hall for this important delivery. The press will hopefully be there too, for the largest ever, legally-binding petition in the country for a change of local governance. This is the culmination of a year’s networking with communities, nearly 20,000 conversations across the city about our community rights under the Localism Act. 

Before Friday extra online signatures are still possible. The short link is <a href="https://bit.ly/sheffpp">here</a></td>
