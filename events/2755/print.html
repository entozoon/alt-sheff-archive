		<td>It should be an interesting Full Council meeting of Sheffield City Council on 5 June at 2.00, with various groups packing into the public gallery. To join them arrive before the start and register at the reception to say you would like to sit in the public gallery.

<a href="http://www.sheffieldclimatealliance.net/">Sheffield Climate Alliance</a> will be presenting an Anti-Fracking petition, calling on the council to oppose new fossil fuel extraction such as hydraulic fracturing (fracking), but also coal bed methane and coal bed gasification which are more likely in Yorkshire and Derbyshire, to avoid catastrophic climate chaos. The science of this is set out in a new American film <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsIfokifwSo">"Do the Math"</a> that can be viewed free of charge on Youtube. 

Also, <b>Sheffield Trades Union Council</b> is encouraging support for resolutions indicating opposition to the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government offensive and attempts to coerce democratically elected local government into doing its dirty business. 

Motions include anti-“bedroom tax” (applications for emergency help with housing have jumped from 100 to 1,400 per month). 

Another challenges changes to planning application rules which could mean payday loans shops, fast food takeaways and betting shops opening with no planning permission required from the Council. 

Child poverty will also be discussed; it is estimated to have increased from 17.5% in 2010 to 20.5% in 2013.</td>
