* What do banks really do? 
* What myths surround money, austerity and public debt? 

In this Positive Money public talk, Peter Verity will explain how money creation by private banks leads to debt and inequality, and why public money creation is the solution for a just economic future.
 
Illustrated talk followed by discussion. Voluntary donations to cover costs (up to Â£5 depending on ability to pay). This meetup is for everyone interested in how our money system works and how it could be changed to be constructive and socially beneficial. Come and feel free to invite your friends who might be interested too. Everyone is welcome.
