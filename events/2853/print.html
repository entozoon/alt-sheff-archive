		<td>Open Rights Group Sheffield is for anyone interested in digital rights, copyright, freedom of expression, censorship .. all the politics of the internet. You do not have to be a member to come to meet-ups. 

This month, a practical workshop for anyone interested in keeping their digital lives private. Bring your computer and they will help you secure it and your communications. Full disk encryption for computers and memory sticks; encrypted email, text messages, anonymous browsing and tracker-avoidance;   censorship circumvention; password generation, databases and management; keysigning / extending the web-of-trust. 

Plus discussion of the laws that govern who can access your stuff and when and a regular round-up of the latest digital-rights news, opinions, and happenings.

You do not have to sign up here to come along - but if you do it helps to avoid exceeding the venue capacity. Pseudonymous sign-ups are fine! Drop in for a few minutes to ask a question or stay all evening.
