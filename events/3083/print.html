		<td>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR; the foremost statement of the rights and freedoms of all human beings) was adopted on 10 December 1948. The date has since served to mark Human Rights Day worldwide. Drafted by representatives of all regions and legal traditions, it has been translated and disseminated into more than 380 languages and dialects, from Abkhaz to Zulu and is thus the most translated document, indeed, the most "universal" one in the world. 

This event to celebrate International Human Rights Day is open to the public, with speakers including: 

Paulette Edwards (BBC Radio Sheffield)
Mike McColgan
Nikki Bond
City of Sanctuary Sheffield
Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign 
Sheffield Amnesty International
SCALP (Against Library Privatisation)

The event will culminate in a screening of Jahar Panahi&#39;s "This Is Not a Film"

FREE admission.
