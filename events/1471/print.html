		<td>Djoly (Bavwidi Mpanzu) will know the result of his legal challenge to deportation in one week's time. To help pay for this challenge the Justice for Djoly campaign has raised over £2200, from a wide range of supporters, once again demonstrating the fact that Djoly is widely respected and supported in South Yorkshire. But the campaign is still £100's short of what's needed to pay legal fees.

To help raise money and to explain some of the radical history of Djoly's country, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the campaign has organised a fundraising film screening of the film 'Lumumba'. Patrice Lumumba was the first prime minister of the then newly independent Congo DRC, he is regarded as one the greatest Pan-Africanists, and his assassination remains very controversial. After the screening discussion of whether subsequent DRC and other African governments have followed his legacy. Everyone welcome, please bring a donation. Speakers include former leading political figures from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Marie Therese Nlandu and Noel Mbala.

You can also donate to the campaign sending cheques to South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG), please write "Djoly / your name" on the back of the cheque and post it to SYMAAG, Scotia Works Leadmill Road, Sheffield S1 4SE.

Doors open at 5.30pm for tea and coffee before the film.
