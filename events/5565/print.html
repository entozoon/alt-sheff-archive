		<td>This Saturday, Extinction Rebellion Sheffield will be taking to the streets to install semi-permanent environmental art in the centre of our city. Make Sheffield Beautiful Again: Climate Rebels Paint the Streets of Sheffield will spread the climate call to action by gifting Sheffield a vibrant piece of climate art with the help of proud Sheffielders. The work will be done on routes in Sheffield, culminating outside the Town Hall.

The aim is to keep the climate emergency firmly in the spotlight and inform people of Extinction Rebellion’s International Week of Action that will commence on April 15th, when thousands of ordinary people around the world will stand up for their planet. 

They invite all who are interested to stop by to speak to Extinction Rebellion activists about how they can get involved in the movement and join in acts of nonviolent civil disobedience around the world. Jade Clarke, Paint the Streets of Sheffield Coordinator says “realise your power and join the rebellion. We can insist on altering our systems and cultures to become regenerative. Our future is our’s to shape. Business as usual will not hold. We can’t wait for action, we are the action.” Extinction Rebellion welcomes all those who demand a better tomorrow free from climate catastrophe.
