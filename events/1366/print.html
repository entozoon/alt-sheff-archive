		<td>Public meeting on tax and economic inequality, with speakers including John Christensen and Karen Reay.

Karen Reay, Unite Officer for Yorkshire and Humber, speaker for the <a href="http://www.robinhoodtax.org/">Robin Hood campaign</a>, and a former health visitor, is in the thick of campaigns against cuts to public services. She is former National Officer for Health, and sees the Robin Hood Tax as one key way to avoid public service cuts.

John Christensen, of the Tax Justice Network, has researched tax havens and tax policy for many years. He has also played a leading role in campaigning for tighter regulation and control of tax havens and offshore finance centres. Speaking on BBC Radio Sheffield on Tuesday, John Christensen made clear that tax reform would both increase equality between rich and poor, and stop the need for cuts.
