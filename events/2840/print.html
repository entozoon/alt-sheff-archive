		<td>The politics of solidarity versus racism and xenophobia, a One Sheffield Many Cultures seminar with speaker Danny Dorling, well known writer and academic from Sheffield University. He is a prolific user of facts to refute the myths about inequality and racism in Britain. He will shortly be leaving the city to take up a post at Oxford University. 

We are living through times when we are seeing new challenges to the progress we have made in both creating and maintaining our multicultural society. In an age of austerity there are those who wish to use racism and xenophobia to divide us and scapegoat whole communities for social and economic problems they did not create.

This seminar is an opportunity to discuss in detail how we can strengthen the politics of solidarity in the face of the growing legitimisation of racism and xenophobia.
