		<td>Calling all musicians, poets, dancers and artists. As part of <a href="http://alt-sheff.org/events/1694">Pandemic</a>, reclaiming space, reappropriating images, UKuncut Sheffield will turn a bank into a live music venue. Bring your rhymes. Bring your rhythms. Bring your instruments, your sense of humour and, most importantly, your sense of injustice to highlight bankers&#39; bonuses and corporate greed in what is sure to be UKUncut&#39;s most exciting event this year.
