		<td>A documentary screening exploring the global obsession with the music phenomenon, Afrobeats. From its origins in Lagos through to new manifestations of Afrobeats happening from the US, to Cuba and beyond.

Bakosó: Afrobeats de Cuba follows DJ Jigüe to his hometown of Santiago de Cuba as he reconnects with his roots in search of inspiration for new sounds. He finds Afrobeats has helped create a new genre called Bakosó, which itself is beautiful proof that the exchange between Cuba and Africa did not end with the Transatlantic slave trade. Through stunning visuals and a score created by the founders of the genre, the film shows the technology, culture and landscape that shape this African-Caribbean fusion.

This screening will be followed by a live performance; a musical, percussive story-telling journey through the history of Afrobeat with Afro-futurist K.O.G (K.O.G and the Zongo Brigade, Onipa) using traditional African instruments, vocals and rhythms. K.O.G is an internationally renowned professional musician, artist, songwriter, percussionist and multi-instrumentalist originating from Ghana and based in Sheffield, UK. 

Part of Africa 3.0, a mini-strand showcasing stories of obsession from the African continent. Also screening as part of this strand is Cairo Station, Youssef Chahine’s pioneering Egyptian film in which a newspaper vendor’s infatuation with a woman turns into madness.
