		<td>Deported to Cameroon, depsite being married to a British citizen, Bernard is separated from his wife and step-children. This is just one example of the injustices of the UK immigration and asylum system. But for this family it is their whole life split apart. Please call by if you can get to the town centre today, to make this a strong protest.
