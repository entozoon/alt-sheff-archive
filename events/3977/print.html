		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. This month, in the last month of the tax year they are going to ride to sites of taxdodgers like Starbucks, Vodaphone etc etc.  

Last time they left food for the foodbanks, this time the plan is to leave letters/petitions about the need for us all to pay tax and not for tax avoidance to be the privilege of the rich and/or corporations. They will recount how much each enterprise avoids at each stop. More details on the website.
