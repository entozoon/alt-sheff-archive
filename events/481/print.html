		<td>Join other activists to distribute the latest 'HOPE Not Hate' leaflet in Stainforth. This event is organised by and being run by Doncaster REC (Race Equality Council). HOPE not hate was set up to counter racism and fascism in elections and beyond. Exposing the BNP and giving activists the resources they need to get out onto the streets to campaign for 'HOPE Not Hate' has never been more important.
