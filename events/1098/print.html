		<td>Gay Icons Project runs in Sheffield through November and December. It explores the contrasting characteristics of gay iconography. The project is both an introduction to historical gay culture for non-gay audiences, and a celebration of achievement among Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered communities, experiencing empowerment in the knowledge that they live in a city, in a time where a project of this nature can now take place.

Launch party tickets £4.50 (advance), £5 (door)
