		<td>The Hallamshire Guild of Weavers, Spinners and Dyers are holding a special fundraising event and exhibition for the Farm.

Using traditional techniques they will turn a sheep&#39;s fleece into a unique throw to be raffled off to raise money for the Farm. Come and see them carding (combing) the wool, spinning it into yarn and knitting the throw over two days. You could even have a go yourself!

Held in Reception Classroom near the pond from 10am - 4pm on the 5th & 6th May. Suitable for all the family - once you&#39;ve watched the spinning and other techniques you can go and see our cute piglets, lambs and goat kids - they&#39;ve had several born over the last two weeks! Free to see - they will be selling raffle tickets.

Ring 0114 2451322 for more details. <a href="http://www.heeleyfarm.org.uk/">Heeley City Farm</a> is 20 mins walk from Sheffield, Bus 33 or 47</td>
