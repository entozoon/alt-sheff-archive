		<td>Sheffield's anarchist walking group celebration of 24th April (Easter Sunday) the 79th Anniversary of the Mass Trespass in 1932 when nearly 500 ramblers highlighted the lack of public access to open countryside, clashing with game keepers and police. It was a key moment in opening up public access to the countryside.

Meet at Sheffield train station at 11am to catch the 11.14 to Edale, or meet at Edale train station by 11.45am. The walk is about 5-6 hours long and quite hard going involving scrambling and some steep uphills and downhills and some of it can be
boggy if its been raining, but the views are amazing and well worth the effort. 

Accompanied children who can manage such a walk are very welcome but the walk is impossible for buggies. Bring lunch and all other drinks and snacks as there is nowhere to buy anything along the way, and sturdy footwear, waterproofs, OS map etc. The aim is to catch the 18.32pm train back to Sheffield (arrives
Sheffield at 19.06) 

If you want to see the walk it is here:
