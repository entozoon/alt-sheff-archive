		<td>Sharrow Lantern Carnival will once again draw in thousands to raise their lanterns high and process through the streets of Sharrow, creating a fantastic carnival atmosphere. This year the theme is Roots; whether it is nature, history or music that influences you, come and make a free lantern with your local community. 

Creative Action Network is putting on over 30 FREE lantern-making workshops during February and March. There is no need for any experience and all the materials are provided. Workshops continue on Saturdays, 12-4pm until the 6th April, in 2 venues: smaller lanterns at the Old Junior School, South View Road, Sharrow, and larger lanterns at The Hub, behind Mount Pleasant on Sharrow Lane. This year there are also extra big lantern making sessions on Thursday evenings at The Old Junior School until 4th April, 7-10pm. This will be a great opportunity to create huge willow structures with friends and family.

If you want to support the carnival through volunteering at workshops, stewarding on the day or help to raise funds please get in touch. The carnival has no funding this year and so is running purely on donations. They need to raise another Â£1300 through events and activities.
