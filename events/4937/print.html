		<td>Access Space opens its doors on Wednesdays for you to bring in broken items and they will help you to learn how to repair them. This includes computer/electrical stuff, even clothing or furniture, etc. Our current capitalist system produces inferior products designed to go wrong and need replacing, with the cost paid by us, and the environment. <strong>#FightForYourRightToRepair</strong> is the new movement promoting the end to this &#39;built-in obsolence&#39; and unrepairable goods.
