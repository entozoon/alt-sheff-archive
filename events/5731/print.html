		<td>Green Parents will hold up a huge banner with the words ‘For the Love of Our Children Act Now’ which is being passed between parents as part of a nationwide protest across the country. It started in London on 7th July, visiting 11 cities and towns over 11 weeks – symbolising the 11 years climate scientists say we have left to prevent catastrophic climate breakdown. It will finish with a mothers’ protest in London as part of a week of global climate action in September.

‘Mothers Rise Up’, the network of mums behind the banner relay, are calling on MPs to up the pressure for deeper and more rapid emissions reductions through measures such as a ban on dirty energy including fracking and a massive expansion in renewable energy.
