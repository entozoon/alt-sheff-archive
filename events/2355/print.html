		<td>How have recent events changed the prospect of nuclear disarmament? Has warfare moved beyond the nuclear option?

A presentation organised by the Sheffield Humanist Society. Ankie Hoogvelt of Sheffield CND will look at how the response of the US to the rise of China, the realistic assessment on the part of a growing number of US policy makers of the "nuclear equaliser" (as when small countries can acquire nuclear weapons) and technological advance in cyber warfare have changed the prospect of nuclear disarmament.

There will be a meeting of another group in the main bar at the Showroom, please follow direction notices on the doors so that the other meeting is not disturbed.
