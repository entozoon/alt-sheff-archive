		<td>We have 2.5 million unemployed, and we have empty factories, offices and shops â€“ everything we need in fact to produce the goods and services society needs. Yet the economy seems to be unable to produce enough real wealth for lack of money. Where does money come from? Who creates it? And what are the implications for our failing economy?

This talk looks at how our debt-based money system is the root cause of many of our economic problems, and explains the Positive Money proposals to reform and democratise our money supply. 

Positive Money is a UK-wide organisation campaigning for monetary reform and an end to debt slavery. They believe that the power to create money should be taken from the private banks and returned to the people to whom it properly belongs. 
Free event (but donations to cover cost of room welcome).
