		<td>An evening of musical delights celebrating diversity and raising funds for Diversity Fest 2017: 

 7.30-8 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PetitPierreSound/">Petit Pierre</a>: Electronic rock / Dark pop.

 8.15-8.45 <a href="http://mwoollard.webs.com/">Madge Woollard</a>: Excellent piano and bass duo (as seen at Sheffield Pride 2016 and Diversity Fest 2015 & 2016).

 9-9.30 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/liomusicofficial/?fref=tsLIO">LIO</a>: As a little girl, LIO’s back garden was her stage. Over the years she clearly outgrew the birds and the bees, and during her year abroad in Sheffield, UK her passion for music became stronger than ever. LIO is a little hippie at heart, and creates beautiful Indie and Folk music. She sings about love, heartbreak, and the ever present figments of her imagination. So if you listen close enough you might just find out what she truly thinks of you (as seen at Diversity Fest 2016).

 11.45-12.45 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/globologist/?fref=ts">The Globologist</a>: Amazing global music DJ (as seen at Diversity Fest 2015).
