		<td>Townsend Productions presents a powerful new play by Neil Gore, based on the true story of one of the most turbulent industrial battles â€“ the 1972 Builders&#39; Strike. With 1970s popular and political songs arranged by renowned folk musician John Kirkpatrick. 

Building workers faced the most dangerous working conditions and poorest wages of any trade, while the companies were making millions rebuilding the country. The industry&#39;s first national all-out strike was to end cash "lump" wages and seek better pay by using the controversial tactic of &#39;Flying Pickets&#39;. It was a success, but then 24 builders were prosecuted for offences including conspiracy and affray. They became known as "The Shrewsbury 24", and three of them were jailed, including Des Warren and Ricky Tomlinson (later known for acting roles as Bobby Grant in Brookside, DCI Charlie Wise in Cracker and Jim Royle in The Royle Family). Ricky Tomlinson is still seeking to overturn the unjust prosecution of the 24 workers.
