		<td>A big decision at the AGM for Sheffield Anti Cuts Alliance: it has been agreed that a national network of non-party, anti-cuts groups is needed, and that the People&#39;s Assembly now fulfils that role. Several of those active in SACA have been working for some time with the local South Yorkshire People&#39;s Assembly, and some have become elected officers within it. There there is no point in running 2 parallel umbrella anti-cuts organisations, so the proposal is that SACA be dissolved, in accordance with the constitution, and remaining funds and activities be transferred to the South Yorkshire/Sheffield People&#39;s Assembly. This requires a vote at the AGM to dissolve SACA as a distinct organisation.
