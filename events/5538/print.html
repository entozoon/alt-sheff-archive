		<td>The Spanish Civil War resulted in the fascist regime of Franco, lasting almost 40 years.

What drove this rise in conservatism and the popularity of Francoism? How was it able to defeat Republican Spain? The events of the Civil War and the brutal repression following it are still alive in the Spanish memory today. Recent police brutality against those protesting for an independent Catalonia reminds us of SpainÂ´s repressive history, and the legacy of nationalism which continues to plague the country.

Event hosted by University of Sheffield Sheffield Marxist Society.
