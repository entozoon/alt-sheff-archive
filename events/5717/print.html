		<td>An evening of great music as a living testimony to the fact that cultures can and do mix. It unites us and gives us strength, and offers a vibrant celebration of our multicultural and multiracial society. Racism seeks only to divide and weaken us. Love Music Hate Racism (LMHR) was set up in 2002 in response to rising levels of racism, in the tradition of the Rock Against Racism (RAR) movement of the late 1970s. There have been now been many hundreds of LMHR events, from large outdoor festivals to local gigs and club nights. It is time to reignite our national movement against racism through music. 

BASSIK - Sheffield based D’n’B DJ and Producer and more acts to be announced. 18+ only.
