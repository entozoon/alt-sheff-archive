		<th>Details</th>
		<td>All around the world journalists are attacked and killed in the exercise of the right to freedom of expression. This Question-Time style debate, chaired by William Horsley, explores the variety of ways that freedom of expression in journalism is placed in danger. The event will bring together experts from the worlds of journalism, higher education, NGOs and research organisations to debate journalistic freedom. The audience will be able to submit questions in advance to the panel of high profile guests.

The event profiles the research of the Centre for Freedom of the Media (CFOM) at The University of Sheffield. CFOM wishes to engage the public with the range of difficulties involved in reconciling the right to freedom of expression with constraints imposed on journalistic freedoms.

This event is free admission but places must booked at the Crucible box office either in person or tel. Sheff 2496000, or use the "Book now" button on website. Part of this year&#39;s Off the Shelf Festival of Words, now running at various venues around Sheffield.
