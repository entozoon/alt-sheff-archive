		<td>Continuing the campaign against forced unpaid work, and part of Boycott Workfare national week of action, to put pressure on a workfare exploiter.

The ongoing resistance to workfare schemes is causing more and more companies to pull out, with Argos and Homebase being the latest two to give up after being targeted by protests, so join us to help us finish off workfare for good.

Meeting up outside the Town Hall at 1, then moving off to pay a visit to a workfare exploiter and let them know what we think of unpaid work.

More about workfare:

Workfare is sold as a way to help young people by giving them work experience. In fact, it hurts us all, by allowing employers to replace paid jobs and undermine pay and conditions, meaning there won’t be careers for young people to go into. Why would employers bother paying staff if the government is offering them forced labour for free? Workfare schemes are a subsidy to business, providing them with free workers at public expense. Pressuring unemployed people into working for free affects everyone, as workfare means less pay for us and more profits for big companies. Instead of making it easier for people to get jobs, workfare will mean more people end up unemployed as their jobs are replaced by unpaid placements.

But we can fight back against workfare. Campaigns have already forced a number of big employers, like Holland & Barrett, to pull out, and if we keep the pressure up we can achieve even more. It’s not about workers versus unemployed, we all need to stick together to defend our living standards against the bosses.</td>
