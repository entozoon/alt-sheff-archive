		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A public meeting, "We Touched the Sky" is organised by South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG) and the local Chilean community. Come and learn about the experience of Chilean refugees who came to Sheffield in the 1970s. 

It is often forgotten that refugees have been welcomed, and their experience of fighting injustice has been valued here. But that was part of the experience of Chilean refugees who came to South Yorkshire in the 1970s fleeing the military coup. While the UK Government did nothing to defend the elected Chilean Government against dictatorship, trade unions welcomed and supported activists who shared their organising skills and courage. 

The main speaker is Dr Jasmine Gideon, senior lecturer in Development Studies in the Geography Department at Birkbeck, University of London. She has recently published research on the health and well-being of Chilean refugee women in the UK. She will be joined by speakers from the Chilean community in Sheffield and a representative from the Sheffield labour movement who supported Chilean refugees in the 1970s.

The meeting is free though the groups would welcome a donation to cover room-hire costs. Doors open at 6.30pm for pre-meeting refreshments. If lack of money is a barrier to attending any SYMAAG event, bring your ticket/receipt to the meeting and they can reimburse you in cash at the meeting for any reasonable travel expenses.
