		<td>As the dominating power of the corporate music industry grew massive, small independent record shops run by enthusiastic local people failed. Except a few. Now vinyl sales are rising and the local stores are fighting back. This annual celebration includes special sales and events at the various shops around the city, followed by a gig in the evening.

"Real" local record shops include:
<a href="http://www.rareandracy.co.uk/">Rare and Racy</a>
<a href="http://www.recordcollectorsheffield.co.uk/">Record Collector</a>
<a href="http://www.musicjunkee.co.uk/">Music Junkee</a>
<a href="http://www.nicholsbuilding.co.uk/">Shado Retro</a>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/VinylDemandRecordShop">Vinyl Demand</a>
<a href="http://www.discogs.com/user/LP.vinyl.sheffield">LP Record Store</a>

In the evening the gig is at Penelopes, 53-55 Arundel Gate S1 2DN from 8pm-2am. It features Screaming Maldini, The Spark, The Retrospectives, and The Shaking Whips. Â£5 entry on the door. (Penelopes door is on the side of the Odeon Cinema building)
