		<td>This is the group for anyone interested in digital rights: copyright, freedom of expression, censorship, parody, privacy, open data, free software. This month a short talk about the impact of internet filtering in the UK and a demonstration of <a href="http://www.blocked.org.uk/">www.blocked.org.uk</a>,  launched in July as part of the Censorship Monitoring Project. Followed by discussions and a workshop session.

If you know of any Sheffield organisations whose websites are being blocked by the filters then please invite them along to get help to get their sites unblocked. Some examples of ones already found are <a href="http://www.gaysheffield.co.uk/">www.GaySheffield.co.uk</a>, an advice, support and health service by Sheffield Teaching Hospitals (blocked by filters on the Three network) and <a href="http://www.sheffieldfeministnetwork.wordpress.com/">www.sheffieldfeministnetwork.wordpress.com</a>, a feminist activism and friendship website blocked by strict filters on TalkTalk.

 You do not have to be a member to come to the meet-ups.
