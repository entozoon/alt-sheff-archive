		<td>A racist offensive against refugees, migrants and Muslims is being pushed by some politicians and press. It is crucial we respond to this by standing in solidarity against attempts to divide our communities. The appalling treatment of refugees across Europe and the staggering rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes must be challenged.

Join the Europe-wide UN Anti-Racism Day Demonstration when tens of thousands march across Britain and around the world send a message that drives back the tide of racism, fascism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism and the scapegoating of migrants and refugees, to say refugees are welcome here and yes to diversity. 

Stand Up To Racism has led some of the biggest anti-racist mobilisations in Britain of the last decade, including the UN Anti-Racism Day demonstrations of 2014 and 2015, and the 100,000 strong Refugees Welcome demo on 12th September 2015.
