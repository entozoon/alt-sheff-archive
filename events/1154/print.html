		<td>From <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/nov/12/tuc-joins-student-protests">The Guardian:</a> "Activists who occupied dozens of Vodafone stores last month, saying that the company had avoided paying Â£6bn in taxes, are planning "a day of mass civil disobedience against tax avoidance" on 4 December targeting other high street names. While Vodafone denies its claim, the group, known as UK Uncut, closed Vodafone stores across the UK.

One co-ordinator of the campaign said: "What we saw with the student demonstration this week is that there is a real anger among a huge section of the population and this is not just the old faces and usual suspects. Many of the people on the Vodafone demonstration had not been involved in demonstrations before but feel like they want to take a stand."

This is a national protest, in Sheffield and other cities. It will not be publicised on Face Book so it cannot be subverted. More details later, hopefully.</td>
