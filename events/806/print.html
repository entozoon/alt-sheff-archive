The Totley Radicals: a walk and talk with Sally Goldsmith and Rony Robinson. John Ruskin, cultural radical, Edward Carpenter, Victorian socialist and gay activist, Harry Brierley, the inventor of stainless steel, GHB Ward, tresspassing 'King of the Ramblers' are just some of the radicals of the late 19th and early 20th century connected with the area around Totley. We will eat our packed lunch in the garden of Fanshawe Gate Hall where George Adams, sandal-making socialist lived at the turn of the century.

Book as early as possible please as they are likely to fill up quickly. Expect wet and roughish walking and gradients, bring strong walking boots, packed lunch, drink and snacks. NO DOGS PLEASE.
