		<td>A gathering to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the South Yorkshire Migration Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG). They would like to invite all supporters to come. Including you!

Over the last 10 years SYMAAG have worked for refugee and migrant rights in the UK and beyond, such as:

·   Supported the struggles of refugees for safety, dignity and justice
·    Helped increase public understanding of how refugees are treated in the UK
·   Educated themselves and others about the global conflicts and injustices that push people to leave their home countries

The work has been rewarding, often successful, so after 10 years, this is a time to reflect, celebrate and prepare for the next 10. 

Live entertainment :
Traditional British music
Professional Salsa dancing.
Iranian pop music, Syrian and Kurdish music.

And Iranian traditional food.

There is no entry fee but SYMAAG welcomes your donations to support the work. You are welcome to bring your own drinks

Please email: <a href="mailto:Jamesrooz5@gmail.com">Jamesrooz5@gmail.com</a> to let them know if you are coming, so they know how much food to prepare. If you want to attend a SYMAAG event but do not have money for transport, bring your ticket to the event and they will reimburse you in cash. Or email in advance.
