		<td>Keith Bolender is a Canadian journalist and lecturer. He is a Cuba specialist who seeks out the views and experiences of ordinary Cubans as well as those of leaders. In his new book Cuba under Siege: American Policy, the Revolution and its People, he uses this approach to tell the story of the impact of unremitting US hostility, the economic blockade, the military attacks, the psychological and media warfare, and not least the terrorist attacks on the Cuban people. This is a rare chance to engage with a writer who seeks out the perspective of ordinary Cubans.</td>
