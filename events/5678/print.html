		<td>Training run by Extinction Rebellion, a peaceful movement addressing the climate crisis through non-violent direct action (NVDA). Find out how to take part in Extinction Rebellion actions. The training will cover the practice of non-violent techniques: how to de-escalate tense situations, how to interact with the police, what to do if you get arrested and much more. 

This training is designed to give you confidence when on protests and is essential for anyone who wishes to get more clued up on their rights and non-violent direct action. Please note, this is not just for those who are willing to get arrested! It is for everyone with an interest in the cause.

Training is free, but small donations to cover room hire costs are appreciated. Please reserve a space so they can keep track of numbers.
