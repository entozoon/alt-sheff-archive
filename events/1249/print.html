		<td>A review of 2010 from a secular-humanist point of view, raising some questions about what's in store during 2011.

2010 saw the Pope come to Britain and attack our traditions of 
secularism and tolerance in a visit that cost us all millions. But what else was going on? Religious leaders are still heard, revered and, if anything, increasing their influence. Is 'God' Fighting Back? Speaker Mike Granville, Sheffield Humanist Society. 

Please note the change of venue for this meeting.
