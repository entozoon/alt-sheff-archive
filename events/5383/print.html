		<td>John Boughton is the researcher and writer behind the website <a href="https://municipaldreams.wordpress.com/">Municipal Dreams</a>. He presents "Municipal Dreams: The Rise and Fall of Council Housing", a history of local authority housing in the UK, including Sheffield. He reviews the idea of state housing, through the Tory disaster of "Right to Buy" and controversial regeneration schemes. Good housing, he argues passionately, is vital for society.
