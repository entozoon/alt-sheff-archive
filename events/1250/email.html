Student arrests defendants meeting

Sun 6 Feb 2011, at 12 noon IN LONDON

Were you arrested at any of the recent student demonstrations?

This meeting in London may be useful to know about. It could help your case to attend and it will definitely help your confidence. This is a meeting for DEFENDANTS ONLY. If you are not a defendant or accompanying a defendant you WILL be asked to leave.

There will be people with legal knowledge, and talk about police use of bail conditions. Most of the meeting will be for defendants to come together and decide if they want a defence campaign, and if so, what type.

If you haven't been arrested, but you are worried you MAY yet be arrested, or if your face has been publicised as somebody the police want to question, it's probably best to stay away, as police have in the past had spotters outside these meetings. BUT don't be put off from coming if you have already been arrested: attending meetings does not breach your bail conditions.

Above all - DON'T BE AFRAID! Many people support you and are willing to help, some have been in this position in the past. The police are not all-powerful, they can be challenged, and getting charged does not mean you will be convicted. Defence campaigns have helped people to win in court, and helped to win support for people facing charges.

Please pass this onto anybody you know who may have been arrested and charged or on police bail.

Venue: KHALILI ROOM at the School of Oriental and African Studies which is on Thornhaugh St (near Malet Street) London WC1H 0XG
This meeting is being organised by the Legal Defense and Monitoring Group (www.ldmg.org.uk ) and the Green & Black Cross (www.greenandblackcross.org ).
