FOR RE-ARRANGED DETAILS SEE WEBSITE (BELOW) Meeting to discuss more Temporary Autonomous Arts events in Sheffield. Sheffield Art and Soul Kollective reclaim and re-use derelict urban spaces to create events out of nothing. They believe in building fleeting pirate utopias, using DIY culture tactics to create space for art, music, film, performance, kids areas and workshops, free expression outside of the established art-world elites.
