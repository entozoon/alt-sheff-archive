		<td>"Power Trip: Fracking in the UK" (63mins) takes you onto the front lines of UK resistance in the battle to stop the controversial energy extraction process known as Fracking. It shows what happens beyond the few seconds glimpsed on the mainstream TV news. Follow grandmothers who set up a campaign group (Lancashire Nanas) and teamed up with younger activists (Reclaim the Power) to shut down the Fracking sites of Cuadrilla. Blackpool and Balcombe, West Sussex, became the frontline of Fracking resistance as trucks were occupied and gates blocked. The film also explores how social media is being used by both Fracking companies and activists.

The screening will be followed by a Q&A (Questions & Answers) with one of the film-makers (Paul Oâ€™Connor) and some of the protestors that are seen taking direct action in the film. Tickets and more information at the link below.
