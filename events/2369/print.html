		<td>Over the past 6 weeks 13 students from the Sheffield School of Architecture have collaborated with SKINN and plastiCities as part of the School of Architecture’s ‘live project’ innovation to progress the vision for the disused urban wild-space, Furnace Park in Shalesmoor.  Although the focus of these 6 weeks has been primarily on Furnace Park the final output provides a framework for potential other temporary, active spaces that can be implemented across Sheffield’s underused urban wild-scapes. 

Overall Furnace Park project will run for the next 3 years and the site strategy has been designed to evolve over the years as the site becomes increasing more populated and recognised within local communities. 

To conclude the 6 week live project there will be an exhibition to introduce the student’s proposed visions for a temporary outdoor creative space to be used by local residents, businesses, students, and arts and community organisations at Furnace Park. 

Drinks and refreshments will be available. All welcome.</td>
