		<td>You are warmly invited to a free choral concert with a difference. The choir will provide a menu of music, and the audience will choose what they sing before each course! There will be a wide variety of pieces to choose from, spanning the 16th to 21st centuries. 

A fundraiser performance by Sheffield Chamber Choir, entrance is free but there will be a collection for South Yorkshire Refugee Law and Justice. This is a locally run charity that helps refugees prepare their own fresh claims for protection. They provide people with support at their lowest point, when they cannot find a solicitor and may be destitute. Their work helps clients move their cases forward, to feel safer and put themselves in a position where they can apply for Home Office accommodation and subsistence. They also work closely with other organisations in Sheffield supporting people seeking asylum.

They rely mainly on volunteers and try to keep costs low, but urgently need funds towards rent, their vital part-time Coordinator and expenses that help clients prepare a good case (for example, the Home Office fee for a copy of their file).

The concert begins at 3.00pm, followed by refreshments at 4.15pm. You can register your interest on this <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/1908131462740212/">Faceook events page</a>.
