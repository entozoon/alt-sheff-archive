		<td>Hilary Rosser and Leni Solinger will be reporting on a recent visit to Palestine where they met with Palestinians living in both the occupied West Bank and Israel. They want to share their experiences from the visit. Even though they knew a lot about the situation before they went they were still stunned by the depth of suffering and strength of spirit of the Palestinian people.
