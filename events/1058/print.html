		<td>Sheffield Cuba Solidarity Campaign Public Meeting with Professor Imti Choonara. Over the past 40 years, Cuba's social policy provided universal access to health care, raising health to the level of highly industrialized countries. It has been observed that Cuban leaders view health indicators as measures of government efficacy, which has resulted in giving health care an unusually prominent place in Cuban government policies. Infant mortality has been reduced from 60 per 1000 live births to about 6, which is the lowest in the hemisphere.

Health indicators in Cuba are not only extraordinary achievements in the face of the US blockade of the island, but the statistics also represent access to high-quality health care for ALL of its people. In Cuba, statistical averages do NOT conceal grotesque inequalities, as elsewhere. How does Cuba achieve such results? 

All are welcome to a rare opportunity to hear a frontline report, by an internationally-renowned specialist. Imti Choonaray is Professor in Child Health, University of Nottingham, based in Derby Children's Hospital. He regularly leads study tours to Cuba, for health professionals.
