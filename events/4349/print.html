		<td>Positive Money is a campaign to create a money and banking system that works FOR society and not against it. They hold monthly meetings at the Quaker Meeting House, the last Monday of the month.

This talk by Mike Black will explain how private banks create the national money supplies, at the same time creating mountains of unsustainable debt. It will be a "back to basics" session, so if Positive Money is fairly new to you, or if you feel you need a refresher, this one is especially for you.

It is also a good opportunity to bring your friends along - help them grow!
 
Before the talk, Peter Verity - group coordinator - will give a (short) review of what is happening in the campaign, both locally and nationally, and where he sees the campaign going in 2016. This will help set the context for newcomers.

The meeting ends at 9pm. They ask for voluntary donations - suggested Â£3 - to cover costs.
