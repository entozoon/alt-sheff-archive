		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The story of Dick Cheney - former US Vice President who rose to power after being an intern in the administration of the corrupt President Nixon. He became a cheerleader for neoliberalism and war under George W Bush, involved in the oil industry and the "War on Terror". A satirical and critical film, very relevant to the current political situation. 

The Film Unit is mainly volunteer-run, and <strong>is not just for students</strong>. It is based in the Nelson Mandela Auditorium, at Western Bank (off Glossop Road).
