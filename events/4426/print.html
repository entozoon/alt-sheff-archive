		<td>Annual General Meeting of Sheffield People’s Assembly to report on the year’s activities and finances and to elect officers for 2016-17.

The People’s Assembly is a broad united national campaign against austerity, cuts and privatisation in our workplaces, community and welfare services. It’s linked to no political party, being based on affiliation by individual supporters, unions, anti-cuts campaigns, and other student, pensioner, unemployed, disabled people’s, women’s, black people’s, youth and LGBT campaigning organisations. It liaises closely with similar movements in other countries resisting austerity measures, and encourages a wide debate on how to protect the welfare state and develop an alternative programme for economic and social recovery.
