		<th>Details</th>
		<td>An event featuring artists working with sound, code, organic and inorganic materials, and the detritus, be it physical or digital, of the Anthropocene Epoch in which we live.

Performances include Vicky Clarke: Materiality. A sound sculpture process which will be documented online with any code/schematics made available as open source. 

Silicone Bake, a collaboration between Alex McLean and Jake Harries, semi-improvised pop and live coded techno tales of sex, food, death, late capitalism and market economics. They will be attempting to use redundant computer technology and the tiny sounds of dead plants. 

Bokkusu; Charlie Collins, Lyn Hodnett and Derek Saw, three of Sheffield’s most creative improvisers playing an array of musical and found objects. Metal, plastics, and a little acoustic techno.

A fundraiser for Access Space to help continue its art and tech work with communities. Tickets £6.
