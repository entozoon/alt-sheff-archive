		<td>Sure Start Centres are under threat of closure and budget cuts. In Sheffield the Council may cut funding to all Sure Starts by 15% when they set the new budget on 4th March. This is a chance to talk with councillors Jillian Creasy and Robert Murphy (Green Party Central Ward) about the proposed cuts. Later (see Wed 23rd) there is a march and picnic, and town centre stalls continue (see Saturdays).
