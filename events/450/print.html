Meeting at the Union for a briefing and to get changed into some lovely white suits for those who want to (like these: <a href="http://www.protectthehuman.com/galleries/shell-hell-university-of-chester-amnesty-society">click for pic</a>). Then off down to the Shell petrol station on Ecclesall Rd to tell people that we object to Shell's violations against human rights.

Shell's damaging practices are stripping the people in the Niger Delta of their human rights and keeping them in poverty. Oil spills, gas flaring and pollution are all having a devastating impact on the land and rivers these communities depend upon. This has to change. Decades of pollution in the Niger Delta has led to serious human rights violations, driving the people of the region into poverty. The oil industry has failed to adequately prevent the impacts of its operations in the Niger Delta.
