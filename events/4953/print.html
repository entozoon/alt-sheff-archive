A festival with a difference. Crowdfunded, the theme is a world which has been destroyed, governments overthrown and cities fallen. What would people do? They would seek a place of sanctuary, life, music and community, like Rebuild. Interactive characters and games, theatre, discussions, skill-sharing for self-reliance, workshops on permaculture, tool making, foraging and live music. But far from just an interesting setting and d√©cor theme, a festival to encourage people to think about their relationship with the environment and ways that we build and structure community, something positive to take back into the real world.
