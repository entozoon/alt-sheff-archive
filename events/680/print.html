		<td>All women are welcome to join the vigil which is calling for the cancellation of the Trident nuclear weapons replacement programme. There will be letters to David Cameron and to Nick Clegg for people to sign pointing out that the Â£76 billion costs would be better spent on the economy, creating jobs and preserving public services and that nuclear weapons do not address our real security needs and lead to a more unstable world.
