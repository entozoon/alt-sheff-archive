Supporters are urged to attend this important meeting about the upcoming referendum  - your input and ideas are crucial! 

Further details (including the venue) will be posted as these are confirmed. 

Everyone is also very welcome to stay on for the formalities of their Annual General Meeting (AGM) approx. 3.45/4.00-4.30pm. New members of the Coordinating Group (CG) will be voted in - please consider this, especially if you have been one of many active supporters contributing your energy, time and/or skills - there is still plenty of work to do! To signal your interest in this, or with questions, please contact the chair on <a href="mailto:rhubba4@gmail.com">rhubba4@gmail.com</a>. 

To formally vote at the AGM or to sit on the CG you need to be a signed-up member of It’s Our City! It’s just a quick form to fill, in advance, they won’t be able to process membership applications on the day. Details are here: <a href="https://www.itsoursheffield.co.uk/membership/"> It’s Our City membership</a> (including information about how they maintain independence from political parties as a community network).
