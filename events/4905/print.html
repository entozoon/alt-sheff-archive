		<td>On UN International Human Rights Day you are invited to join with Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign (SPSC) in a vigil in solidarity with the embattled Palestinian people of Tel Rumeida, as they struggle to retain possession of their ancestral lands. For over thirty years, Arwa Abu Haikal and her family have tried to prevent the takeover of their land on the hill of Tel Rumeida in Hebron by fanatical Zionist settlers, who are aided and protected by a large force of Israeli military.

Year after year, they and their fellow Palestinians in Tel Rumeida have endured physical and verbal assaults, vandalism of their property, arbitrary detention and restricted movement. They live under constant threat of harm and even death from fanatical settlers. Amnesty International recently reported that Israel has drastically increased the arbitrary restrictions on movement in and around the Old City of Hebron, with the whole area declared a “closed military zone”. In September, Arwa and all the Palestinian residents of Tel Rumeida were issued with numbers, and told that no-one else, family members or visitors, would be allowed into Tel Rumeida if they could not show that they had a number.
