		<td>UpCycling is the creative transformation of waste into something useful or beautiful. This is a free-entry fundraiser to celebrate and support St. Mary’s and the excellent TimeBuilders skill-sharing project.

The event includes upcyled arts and crafts, FoodCycle international buffet, traditional tea tent, climbing and caving, birds of prey display, games and family fun.

​They welcome enquiries if you want to sell upcycled crafts, display upcycled sculptures, or your organisation’s work fits within the upcycle theme. Architecture students who fancy designing and building a temporary upcycle pavilion are particularly welcome (<a href="https://www.timebuilders.org.uk/upcycle-pavilion">click here</a>).
