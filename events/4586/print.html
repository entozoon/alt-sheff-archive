		<td>Co-operatives Fortnight, launched in 2010, is the time when co-operatives up and down the country remind people what&#39;s great about choosing co-operation (instead of competition which capitalist businesses claim solves problems).

Among the activities will be "Big Co-op Cleans", making a difference and showing that we achieve more together than we can alone. Anyone can help to organise a Big Co-op Clean, or encourage people to choose co-operatives in other ways, with free resources from Co-operatives UK. 

<strong>â€œCo-operatives Fortnight is an opportunity for us to shout about how proud we are to be a co-operative." Kellie Bubble, director, Unicorn Grocery.
</strong>
Details of local activities will be listed here.
