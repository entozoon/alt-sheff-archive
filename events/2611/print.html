		<td>On the last Wednesday every March, a day for publicising what it really means when documents are in a format that is not open standards. This could be public information, but people can be locked out from reading it, and that cannot be right. 

If you want to understand why and how "The geeks shall inherit the earth", find out about this issue. About twice the geeks have their day to talk (the other is Software Freedom Day) and this open standards/free and open software/open commons stuff is the socio-political aspect of future computing.

Activities in Sheffield will centre around <a href="http://www.access-space.org/">Access Space</a> and perhaps the Open Rights Group.
