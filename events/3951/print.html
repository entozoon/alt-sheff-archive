		<td>Monthly meeting of Global Justice Now (formerly World Development Movement) to discuss upcoming events and campaigns. Main business: planning and roughing-out materials for summer stalls. The two main campaigns, which have obvious important links with each other, are Stop the Corporate Takeover of Africaâ€™s Food, and Stop TTIP (the corporate-driven, democracy-destroying proposed US-EU trade deal).
