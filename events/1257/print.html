		<td>The nice guys who run Thirsty Ear events have kindly volunteered to throw a party in order to raise much needed funds for this year's festival! If you're around, you should come... Peace in the Park is Sheffield's brilliant annual free festival, all run by voluntary effort - and proceeds go to charity, not to O2 or somesuch vulture capitalists!

Expect a night of reggae, funk, soul, hip-hop, beats, bass, bangers...with additional top quality locally-sourced guest DJ talent!

£2 before midnight or £3 afterwards - bargain! Here's a link to the event's Facebook: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=170664319643390">http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=170664319643390</a></td>
