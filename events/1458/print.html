		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Help us persuade the good people of Fulwood to Vote Yes on 5th May in the referendum on changing to the Alternative Vote. Just turn up  outside the Coop.  

Stall, balloons, leaflets - and the amazing one-and-only "AV" biscuits, only place you will get them in the UK...

Only "Yes" biscuits can challenge this uniqueness, and they too will be available.

But the main point, of course, is to persuade those who are still unsure of how to vote next week that "Yes" is the way to make all our votes count.</td>
