		<td>Annual General Meeting of the Sheffield branch of the radical anti-poverty campaigning pressure group, World Development Movement. 

Start 7pm, refreshments from 7.15pm, followed by a talk at 7.30pm, open to all, on ‘exploring African Alternatives’ by James Oporia-Ekwaro. Don’t miss this excellent chance to hear some first-hand insights into the richly diverse continent of Africa, and to understand something of how some of its countries, individually, have come to be where they are now and how they are currently addressing some of the varied issues that they face. There will be plenty of time for discussion, and the chance to ask your own questions.

James Oporia-Ekwaro grew up in Uganda but had to go into political exile because of his opposition to Idi Amin. He later returned to Ugandan politics, eventually being appointed Ambassador to China, North Korea, Vietnam and Cambodia, based in Beijing (1979-83). A few years later he again went into political exile because of the effective military dictatorship imposed by the current regime, and from 1992 to 1996 worked in many African countries as Christian Aid’s Director for Africa and the Middle East. For the last ten years, he has been teaching a graduate MSc. course in International Development at the Department of Planning Unit of University College, London.
