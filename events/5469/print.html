		<td>A festive fundraiser for South Yorkshire Refugee Law And Justice. Sheffield Chamber Choir is supporting refugees again with a concert of beautiful music and fun Christmas carols. The choir will bring back their popular "Christmas Ã  la Carte" concert. Everyone gets a vote as you go through the menu of music then the choir sings the top choices! Sit back and be blown away by their performance. Uplifting music to make a lovely end to your week.

South Yorkshire Refugee Law and Justice is a small charity working in partnership with others in the city. It helps asylum seekers to make fresh claims for protection when they cannot find lawyers and have nowhere else to turn. This fundraiser is a major event for SYRLJ - any money raised will make a huge difference to their ability to give practical support to asylum seekers in the most need.

Entrance is free but donations of whatever you can spare are welcomed. The concert will last just over an hour, and be followed by tea cake around 4.15pm till 5pm.
