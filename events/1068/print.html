		<td>Polite leafletting of Sheffield DocFest about Israel's cultural normalisation of its apartheid policies and practices, including an official Israeli delegation sponsored by British-Israeli Arts, which is a British Council initiative with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Culture and Sport in Israel. 

Sheffield DocFest is a MAJOR  and EXCELLENT FESTIVAL and this is not an attack on it or its delegates; it is a call for an awareness of the politics involved (says the leaflet). In fact the DocFest includes a panel session on the difficulties facing Middle Eastern filmmakers. 

Hundreds of filmmakers and other cultural workers have pledged  not to take money from any institution linked to the government of Israel until Israel complies with international law and universal principles of human rights. 

There are two major sessions in the Town Hall Reception Room, which holds 200 people: the 'BBC Interview' with Danny Cohen, Controller of BBC3, will finish at about 2.45; the 'Channel 4 Interview' with Stephen Lambert (Wife Swap, The Secret Millionaire, Undercover Boss) will start at 3.30.

Another leaflet session see tomorrow (6th). For more details email <a href="mailto:amartin200@yahoo.co.uk">Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Cultural Boycott Group</a></td>
