		<td>In Jerusalem, 1948, Hind Hussseini comes across 55 orphaned children who she takes in. She has soon built the Dar Al-Tifel institute with over 200 orphans. Miral becomes a new addition following her mother's death, but the safety net of the institute’s walls means she is naive to the troubles that surround her. At the age of 17, she is awakened to the reality of her people's struggle.

The film is directed by Julian Schnabel (The Diving Bell and the Butterfly) and stars Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire). Shown as part of the <a href="http://www.showroomworkstation.org.uk/cinemapalestino">Cinema Palestino</a> season. Entry £5.

The Showroom are doing a £20 offer to see all Cinema Palestino films over the weekend, and the Showroom restaurant is putting on Palestinian food all the weekend with a £25 deal for a meal for two including a bottle of wine and two tickets to a film.

50% of the net profits from the season will be donated back to children's projects sponsored by <a href="http://www.sheffieldpsc.org.uk/">Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign</a></td>
