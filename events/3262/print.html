		<td>Open Data Sheffield is a regular meetup for anyone interested in using data to create new services and improve the public sector and transparency. The diverse community gathers on the third Monday of every month. Anyone is welcome who has an interest in unlocking the social and economic value of public data, presenting meaningful ways to reveal the underlying stories behind policy making and public sector performance or wants to help local bodies engage with the community to create and publish coherent and useful open data. This month: INSPIRE datasets, and The Better With Data Society. Lots of new datasets to explore and examine, plus some feedback from the latest Hack the City event. 

As part of the EU&#39;s INSPIRE programme for promoting superb quality geo-spatial data, Sheffield Council have released 13 datasets on www.data.gov.uk. They include air quality, contaminated land, parks, flood risk zones, allotments, recycling & conservation sites, city centre parking and more. Have a play with them here, see how you got on with them here, come and talk with the team behind them and share your feedback.

The Better With Data Society: A look forward to a better way to grow the city&#39;s open data community and ecosystem. Come and find out what Better With Data is all about, and find out how you can get involved, and how you can shape it. 

Also a look forward to Open Data Day on 22 Feb. If you want to showcase your projects, get in touch.

The Rutland Arms is open from noon and serving food. Gathering upstairs from 6pm for registration and pre-meeting chat, 6.15pm start.
