		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The annual celebration of community and creativity in the beautiful Town Hall Reception Rooms. A mix of affinity and charity stalls and crafts, as well as News From Nowhere, a cooperative book store in Liverpool. Ethical and affordable festive gifts, a wide range of quality crafts direct from the makers and campaigning and charity group stalls. 

 There has been a fair around this time for decades, ever since the heady days of the Republic of South Yorkshire, Nuclear Free Zone, the Sheffield Peace Shop and the first ever Council Peace Officer. It is also a rare opportunity for Sheffielders to come into the Town Hall and see its splendours. 

Shoppers will be entertained at 12:00 by Band For Life and by Jackalope Tales later in the afternoon. In between, Phil Croft, the wandering accordionist, will even do requests. 

Refreshments will be served.
