		<td>Ashes and Diamonds is a tribute to the mining industry and those who fought so long and hard to defend it. It also aims to raise awareness and debate on relevant issues for today, from the ongoing theft from the Mineworkers Pension fund to the loss of all of our once great industries. It returns after a well-received world tour, to South Yorkshire and to Wortley Hall, (the &#34;workers&#39; stately hall&#34;). The creator, Darren Coffield, is a leading London artist. 

Alongside the exhibition there are special events on the 8th and 11th, details given here.

Organised by the <a href="http://www.justiceformineworkers.org.uk/">National Justice for Mineworkers Campaign</a> and supported by Derbyshire NUM
