		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Join authors Liam Barrington-Bush and Peter Johnson who will be proposing ideas for better workplaces. Liam will argue that organisations should be "more like people"; with less control and more freedom. Peter will discuss his vision of the workplace in which control is pushed back and employees are motivated by their own individual values.

They will both be criticising the mechanistic-measurement (processes, hierarchy, targets) approach to work that currently dominates. They will also discuss the opportunity that social media, social movements and complexity science offers for their ideas of the future of work.

Strip The Willow is off Abbeydale Road.
