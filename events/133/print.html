		<td>SYMAAG is a campaigning group which aims to improve the treatment of people who come to South Yorkshire, whether because of threats to their personal safety in their home country or for economic reasons. A partnership between various groups. 

The first item at this meeting will look at the particular issues facing refugee women and women seeking asylum. Discussion will hopefully lead to SYMAAG working with existing womenâ€™s campaigns and helping form new ones in South Yorkshire.

Another current campaign is against government plans to slash allowances to asylum seekers waiting for a decision - see 'Asylum support cuts' in <a href="../../news.html">Alt-Sheff News section</a>
