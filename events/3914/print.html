		<th>Details</th>
		<td>In association with the Political Studies Association Annual Conference and the Crick Centre, a discussion of cutting-edge academic research on ‘deliberative democracy’, which argues that democratic legitimacy is to be found in authentic deliberation among those affected by a collective decision. Prof John Dryzek will discuss the implications of this idea for how we understand and practice politics. Free entry, but please register your attendance.

The Festival of Debate is taking place in Sheffield in the run-up to the General election, during March and April. It provides opportunities to get together and discuss a range of issues which affect everyone. Informed decision making and strategic planning are essential for democracy, so come and get involved. They also welcome volunteers, from attending events and taking part in discussions to volunteering time to help run an event, promote the festival and much more. Unless otherwise stated events are free to attend, but if possible please register via the appropriate Eventbrite link on the Festival of Debate website below to give organsisers an idea of numbers.
