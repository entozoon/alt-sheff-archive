Tent City is a local homelessness project with tents pitched next to the derelict old Park Hill Flats behind the train station. They are highlighting the need for more social housing and provision for homeless people in the city. Residents of Park Hill have been supportive and now they invite all to this Park Hill Clean Up to improve the whole area and address problems by speaking to people face to face.
