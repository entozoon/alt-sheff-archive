		<td>Despite its problems, the NHS is this country’s most popular institution. But the coalition Government’s legislation effectively abolishes the NHS in England after 65 years of existence. April 1st introduces the new NHS regime, which opens the NHS to the private sector. The local Clinical Commissioning Group will be forced to put many NHS services out to competitive tender unless regulations recently tabled in Parliament (which break assurances previously given) are overturned.

To publicly highlight the crucial role that the Liberal Democrats played in helping the Conservative party pass the Health and Social Care Act, the National Health Action Party has organised a run from Leeds to Sheffield. Consultant cancer specialist, Dr Clive Peedell, will be dressing up as David Cameron and will run with his yellow poodle called “Cleggy”, 35 miles from the Department of Health in Leeds (Quarry House), to Nick Clegg’s Sheffield Hallam constituency. His fellow consultant oncologist co-runner, Dr David Wilson will play the role of “Cleggy” in a specially designed poodle outfit, including a collar and lead.

Sheffield Save our NHS will join members of the National Health Action Party and the public by joining the last part of the run and gathering in Sheffield City Centre for speeches. There will also be organised leafleting of Hallam constituency by NHAP supporters.

START - 8.15am Quarry House, Department of Health HQ in Leeds
FINISH - Approximately 4.30pm Sheffield Town Hall and then onto Nick Clegg’s constituency office, 85 Nethergreen Road, Sheffield.
