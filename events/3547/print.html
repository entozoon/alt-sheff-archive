		<td>Join Hollaback Sheffield for a chalk walk raising awareness of street harassment. Bring your own chalk, or just turn up and they will provide some. Free for all to join.

Hollaback Sheffield says: “We thought we’d celebrate Tramlines by raising awareness of street harassment here in Sheffield and reclaim the streets where we have been followed, insulted, harassed or assaulted. Let’s show that street harassment is a real problem but one that we are going to fight! Hope you can make it!”

A Chalk Walk is your way to Hollaback!, your chance to turn the tables.
A Chalk Walk is you reclaiming the street, your freedom.
A Chalk Walk is you healing yourself, telling the world, “I have the right to be here. To be me. To walk wherever, whenever, however I please.”

So bring a piece of chalk with you the next time you’re out walking. Write a message to the person who tried (and FAILED) to intimidate you. And submit or tag a photo of your #chalkwalk to ours…

We Chalk Walk against street harassment, sexism, racism, LGTBQIA-phobia and gender-based violence.
We Chalk Walk to show we share the streets and that we’re all in this together.’ -
