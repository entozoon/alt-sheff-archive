		<td>The next meeting for the planned 2015 Diversity Fest, provisionally lined up for Saturday 19th September 2015 (venue to be confirmed). Following the success of Community Stages at local events over the last 3 years (like Sharrow Festival, Peace In The Park, and Pride), it&#39;s time to launch a new, free festival celebrating diversity in Sheffield.

Expressions of interest are invited from anyone in the Sheffield area and particularly from women and from people from the BME and LGBT communities as well as from people with disabilities / additional needs. The event will be unfunded, run entirely by volunteers and partly indoor / partly outdoor.

If you have any suggestions or would like to help organise and run the event please post a message here or email <a href="mailto:dhtgohj@yahoo.co.uk">dhtgohj@yahoo.co.uk</a>

Let&#39;s add another event to this great Festival City of Sheffield!
