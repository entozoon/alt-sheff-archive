		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Campaigns Workshop: everyone is welcome to join in and help Sheffield Climate Alliance to develop more effective campaigns, working in 3 groups on 3 campaigns:

"Go Fossil Free!" (To get the oil, coal and gas investments out of our pensions, universities and churches, before the bubble bursts)
"Climate Jobs and Warm Homes" (On the huge opportunity to create 6000+ jobs in South Yorkshire that would reduce our energy use)
"Keep It In the Ground" (Against fracking and opencast mining wrecking our environment in the search for ever more fossil fuels).

Sheffield Climate Alliance will have information available about each campaign, and would love your input to help work more effectively and make a real difference - you do not need to be an expert on climate or campaigning!

Note this is a change of date from the usual 2nd or 3rd Tuesday of the month.</td>
