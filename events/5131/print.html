		<td>A bike ride round an 8km route. "Bring your friends, bring your family, bring your bike and join in a traffic-free ride to remember â€“ with loads of free entertainment, plenty to see and have a go at, and a totally new way of experiencing our city".

Sounds great. Includes a free bike check by Halfords, including a blatant marketing voucher for 10% off cycling equipment. Would it be too cynical to ask why funding is needed from National Lottery, Sport England, and HSBC - which has done so much to finance the oil industry? Perhaps they pay for stewarding? No, they are looking for volunteers for key roles. Sign up below.
