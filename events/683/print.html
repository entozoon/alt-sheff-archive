		<td>Basketmaking is one of the oldest of all crafts. It pre-dates pottery and cloth weaving, and led to the invention of both. Spend a day with Ray Lister, of Creative Country Crafts, who has been making and teaching about English baskets for over 20 years, using colourful, locally-grown organic willow. Each student will craft his or her own frame basket in a woodland shelter, sitting by a wood stove. No previous experience necessary. Cost Â£60.
