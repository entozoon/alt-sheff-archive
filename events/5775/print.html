		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Acclaimed Concert Pianist Margaret Fingerhut has devised a very special concert that she is performing across the UK to raise awareness of refugee needs as well as to collect funds for City of Sanctuary. Through music and words, Margaret tells the story of many composers who were refugees because of war or persecution or who migrated for their work.  Her programme includes Chopin, Grieg, Handel, Hayden, Prokofiev and Rachmaninov along with a specially commissioned new piece by Arian, the Kurdish Syrian composer who wrote the Refugee National Anthem for the 2016 Olympics. 

Tickets: £20 + £2 booking fee (Concessions £10 + £1 booking fee) from link below.
