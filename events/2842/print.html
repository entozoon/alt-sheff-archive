		<th>Details</th>
		<td>As part of Summer Saturdays, Art in the Park are running Light Night which will be a city wide takeover opening up spaces, inviting professional and emerging artists to showcase the spaces through various art forms; an open programme of activities, workshops, exhibitions and performances for people to explore the city in a way they haven’t before. Unlocking the doors of spaces we don’t ordinarily get to see, animating places in a completely new way and celebrating what Sheffield has to offer for all ages. 

Imagine entering buildings and spaces you didn’t know existed, finding performers, art installations and activities around every corner and experiencing Sheffield in a completely different way. The city centre will be animated, lit up and celebrated through our city’s artists and performers for one night only to invite you to see Sheffield in a new light.

See website <a href="http://www.artinthepark.org.uk/lightnight">www.artinthepark.org.uk/lightnight</a> for more details. See you all there!</td>
