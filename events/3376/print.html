		<td>Daneshill Community Protection Camp is  near Sutton cum Lound, north of Retford, Nottinghamshire - a few miles south from Sheffield. The camp is protesting that Dart Energy have been given permission to take core samples from coal seams ready for fracking. It is alarmingly near to wetlands and an RSPB centre.
 
They invite you to a special occasion as they party through the full moon and total lunar eclipse where it is probable that the moon will appear to turn dark red.
