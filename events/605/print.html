		<td>The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is a time to reflect on the work SYMAAG has done in the last year and plan for the next. There will be guest speakers from the Still Human, Still Here campaign against the enforced destitution of people seeking asylum and (hopefully) from Women Asylum Seekers Together. If you are not already a member, you can join at the meeting. People seeking asylum, refugees and migrants are especially encouraged to join and lead the work of SYMAAG.

There will also be a display and refreshments.</td>
