		<td>A Palestinian cab driver in Los Angeles struggles to become a legitimate actor while trying to make the money to pay the utilities amidst the chaos of post-9/11 American passengers and Homeland Security. All the while, memories of his life in the theatre back in Palestine pose big questions for his fate and role in his new country.

The film is part of the <a href="http://www.showroomworkstation.org.uk/cinemapalestino">Cinema Palestino</a> season. Entry £5.

The Showroom are doing a £20 offer to see all Cinema Palestino films over the weekend, and the Showroom restaurant is putting on Palestinian food all the weekend with a £25 deal for a meal for two including a bottle of wine and two tickets to a film.

50% of the net profits from the season will be donated back to children's projects sponsored by <a href="http://www.sheffieldpsc.org.uk/">Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign</a></td>
