		<td>Foodhall late: A new sheffield-based collective made up of women and non-binary DJs playing what they want and how they want in a safe and loving environment. They want you to join them in their mission to spread love and have a good old boogie.

All women on the decks, everyone else on the floor.

Foodhall is a community-managed open public dining room and kitchen in the city centre, serving hot meals to all on a contribute-what-you-can basis. They promote excellent values of community, diversity, skill-sharing, education, participation, equality and inclusion. As well as core opening hours for food (10am-3pm every Thursday and Friday) there are many events such as this, see the website for what else is on.

"Lates" are Foodhall fundraising events. They suggest a Â£7 donation on the door, but nobody is turned away for lack of funds. Bring your own drinks. Please be respectful of the space and each other.  Unfortunately the toilets are not wheelchair accessible.
