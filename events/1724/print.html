		<th>Details</th>
		<td>This is a planning meeting for Occupy Sheffield where anyone interested in organising and supporting the event can come and meet, chat and work out the what, where and how of an occupation in Sheffield as part of the worldwide occupy movement.

Things to think on before coming: What can you offer?
Where do you think we should occupy?
What do we need to consider before and during our occupation?
How else can you help?

If there are too many for Wetherspoons then go to the steps of the City Hall opposite John Lewis.
