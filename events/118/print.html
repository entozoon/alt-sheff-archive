		<td><i>Jobs, Education, Peace</i> is a large demonstration at the Labour Party Conference in Brighton. Join the pressure on Gordon Brown, nervous about sending more British troops to Afghanistan, a lively lobby can make sure he thinks twice. The rage people feel over everything that is going on needs channelling to those politicians responsible. There will be delegations from many areas including the Vestas factory who recently visited this area from the UK's only wind turbine factory still fighting illogical closure in the face of government inaction.
