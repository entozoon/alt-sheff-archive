		<td>If you want to find out more about a lifestyle completely free of any animal exploitation come and make friends, drink and eat vegan food at Sheffield Vegan Meet Up. A different venue is chosen every month, which also means exploring vegan-friendly options around the city. This time it is a pub where the owners are both vegan, and vegan curry will be on the menu. The White Lion offers a selection of vegan ales and other vegan alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.
