No need to book, but spaces are limited and allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Part of the 2018 Off the Shelf festival of words. (The venue, Waterstones, ironically is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterstones">now owned by</a> A&NN Capital Fund Management, under Alexander Leonidovich Mamut, a Russian billionaire lawyer, banker and investor.)
