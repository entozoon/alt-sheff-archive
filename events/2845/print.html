		<td>Join the call for the council to commit to no evictions in the benefits squeeze, demand the council reclassify bedrooms to make the "bedroom tax" unworkable, and defend the poor, the marginalised, and the disabled. The Labour council should stop doing the Tories` dirty work, criminalising the poor by dragging people through court.
