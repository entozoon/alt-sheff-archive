		<td>Planning for Sheffield's first ever Bike Festival (Sat 19th June 2010 on Devonshire Green) is just getting started, by a group of people called 'I Bike Sheffield', all keen cyclists organising on a voluntary basis. The group is committed an open and inclusive process. What they need now is your organisation's involvement!

Cycling activities from bike polo to bike decoration competitions, live music, school displays and plenty of stalls should be there. As well as promoting cycling as a means of sustainable transport they welcome other sustainable and ethical organisations, but want interactive displays, things to do, competitions etc. rather than typical worthy but dull petition-signing stalls.

You are invited to come to a meeting and find out what's been talked about so far. There is still lots of scope for new ideas and possibilities, bring anything you can think of! 

This meeting should last about 45 minutes. (Note: on 20th April there's also a planning meeting, see below.)
