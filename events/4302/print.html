		<td>Critical Mass is a fun, free and pro-bicycle ride that takes place in Sheffield (and many other cities around the world) on the last Friday evening of every month. It is a self-organised movement, in other words it happens with whoever turns up. Come and enjoy a nice evening ride around Sheffield for an hour, then off to a pub for a drink and a chat.
