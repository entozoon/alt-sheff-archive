		<td>A day workshop on sculptural wood carving with seasoned sculptor Jason Turpin Thomson. Splitting off sections of local hardwood into rough slabs will be our starting point. Bring your idea or work intuitively on the day, and begin to discover the techniques to release the carver in you. 

Jason is a professional artist and sculptor who has over 25 years of experience working to commission in wood, metal and bone. His output ranges from 25ft tall full tree carvings to hand holdable artworks intuitively carved or meticulously planned. ”It all comes back to carving and the freedom of expression to be found in wood. It’s a humble material that can become glorious through acquired skills that can release your personal artistry.”
