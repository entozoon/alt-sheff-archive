		<td>The repair cafe is a place for people who can mend stuff to bring their tools and get together with people with broken stuff, and share skills and get stuff mended over a cuppa. Bring small electrical appliances, toys, shoes, clothes, pots, kitchen equipment, computers, bikes, audio equipment, furniture, and they`ll see if they can help you mend it. And if you know anyone who is handy with repairing skills, see if they`d like to help out for an hour or two.
