		<td>An inspirational and funny campaigning film. The Yes Men pull off all kinds of amazing actions, pretending to be representatives of top companies, telling the truth about their exploitative practices and getting away with it. It sold out at the Showroom cinema when it was shown there earlier this year. 

All welcome, a WDM film show, in collaboration with Amnesty, Cinema Syndicate and Speak.
