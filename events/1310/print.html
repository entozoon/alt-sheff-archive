		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Friday 4th of March will see Sheffield City Council finalise its budget (not without a protest outside the Town Hall though…) The proposed cuts to Sheffield Library Service will mean a massively reduced mobile library capacity, reductions in opening hours at most branches and the loss of around 33 full-time staff posts. In small service points many of the activities will have to go - this includes babytimes and storytimes. Linked in with proposed cuts to Surestart this is a double whammy to parents of under fives. Despite the fact that we have been assured that no libraries will close this year, there is still another £1.1 million to come off the library budget in 2012/13 and 2013/14. It is hard to see how this won't lead to closures.

We have to make our voice heard now! Get down to your local library for 11am on Saturday 5th March, grab a book and start reading. Make signs and banners to explain why you are there, why you value your library service and why you are opposed to ALL cuts to public services.
