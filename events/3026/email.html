Film: &quot;Be Seeing You&quot; ( &Agrave; bient&ocirc;t, j&rsquo;esp&egrave;re,)

Mon 04 November 6.30pm,  Showroom Cinema, Paternoster Row S1 2B

1968 film by SLON (the “Company for the Launching of New Works”) which worked on a cooperative basis on the idea that cinema should not be thought of solely in terms of commerce.

1967 was the year an important strike broke out at Rhodiaceta, a textile plant owned by the Rhone-Poulenc trust in the city of Besançon, France. The strike was unusual because the workers refused to disassociate the industrial conflict from a social and cultural agenda, demanding changes to not only salary and job security, but also the very lifestyle imposed on them by society. The film’s most important moments are composed of conversations with workers and their wives. They believe the working class is increasingly at the mercy of a system that would like them to remain powerless. The strike developed a sense of their power, which helped lay the groundwork for May 1968, when France was rocked by revolutionary protests.

Followed by "Class of Struggle". Many of the Rhodiaceta workers who had collaborated on the film were unhappy with the final production. In response, SLON filmmakers reorganized their efforts to begin training workers to collaboratively produce their own films. Class of Struggle is their first production. Picking up in Besançon a year after the events depicted in À bientôt, j’espère, the film focuses on agitation by workers at the Yema Watch Factory, particularly the efforts of one recently radicalized worker, Suzanne Zedet. She describes her political activity, and the punishments issued in response by the factory management. She also articulates the radical scope of her and her fellow workers’ demands, which go beyond higher wages and better benefits, and reflect a desire to reorganize the country’s economy and social order.

One of the most radical films produced in an era defined by radicalism, Class of Struggle reflects this will to liberation.
