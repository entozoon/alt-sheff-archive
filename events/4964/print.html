		<td>The first in a series of new events for Sheffield with ‘pay-as-you-feel food’, discussion and organising. Each screening is collaboratively organised so you can sign-up, meet some friendly people and - if you fancy it - get involved. To kick-off, a showing of the powerful recent film about the dehumanising effects of cuts, "I, Daniel Blake".

Sheffield is an active and engaged city. In the past it has been instrumental in national politics, with activism by workers, students and communities. The Festival of Debate has become part of this ongoing history, as it enters its third year with a season for spring 2017. Events include panel discussions, debates, Q&As, artistic responses and keynote speeches, at various venues. The Festival of Debate is hosted by not-for-profit social enterprise <a href="http://www.opusindependents.com/">Opus Independents</a> (which also publishes a monthly Alt-Sheff column in <a href="http://nowthenmagazine.com/sheffield/">Now Then magazine</a>).

A pay-what-you-feel event, please register to attend via the appropriate Tickets For Good link on the website below.
