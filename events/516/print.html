		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The EDL is a racist group linked to the BNP, dedicated to attacking Asian people and Muslims. Islamophobia - bigotry against Muslims - is as unacceptable as any other form of racism. Its aim is to divide us by making scapegoats of one community, just as the Nazis did with the Jews. 

This is an opportunity to discuss an effective response to the court appearance of EDL leaders in Sheffield on Friday, 23rd April, and building the largest possible turnout against an EDL visit on 30th May. Sheffield Unite Against Fascism is calling a peaceful rally to celebrate multicultural Sheffield on that day in opposition.

(NB: THIS EVENT WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED FOR 8TH APRIL)
