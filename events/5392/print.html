		<td>A film screening and Q&A with Palestinian psychiatrist Dr.Samah Jabr. The film shows his work with people traumatised by supporting the resistance to Israeli occupation.

<i>“The Palestinians perceive the Israeli authorities as taking sadistic satisfaction in our suffering. In response, the Palestinians often present a tough exterior, masking their emotions and effacing all signs of vulnerability in the face of those who killed their loved ones. Some Palestinians go further, trying to avoid inflicting further pain on their family members by holding their grief to themselves.”
</i>
Organised by Sheffield Hallam students’ Palestine Society and supported by Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign.
