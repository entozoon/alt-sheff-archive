		<td>Radio Anti (Matthew de Kersaint Giraudeau and Ross Jardine) present a newly commissioned live broadcast about indexical geography and 1:1 scale mapping. Drawing on the fiction of Jorge Luis Borges, Stephen Wright’s research into working at 1:1 scale and Keller Easterling’s work into infrastructure, Radio Anti present an evening of talks, performances and music from the Bloc Projects gallery. 

The event extends de Kersaint Giraudeau and Jardine’s interest in how places are understood through mapping, how mapping might be a kind of place making, and what new index points could be used to orientate ourselves within landscapes that create, and are contingent upon, infrastructures that are in and out of sight.

Structured as a number of short presentations, performances and talks by a range of invited speakers, the event will include a number of breaks with the opportunity for drinks and conversation with the artists and speakers and guests in the adjacent courtyard. Guests are invited to watch individual segments or stay for the full broadcast.

Featuring Keller Easterling, Jonathan Hoskins, Adam James, Lt Col Laurence Quinn, Collette Rayner and Stephen Wright.
