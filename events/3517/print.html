		<td>The monthly meeting of CycleSheffield. This group is for all kinds of cyclists; it organises events, information and rides, and campaigns for cycling to be taken seriously as a means of transport, with the facilities it needs. Thanks to years of promoting cycling, by attending fairs, fetes and other events, and following the Tour de France, CycleSheffield now has over 500 members. 

This month: come along and help develop a plan for the Sheffield cycle network we would all like to see. Everyone is welcome. This will be the first in a series of events to help develop the Sheffield strategic cycle network plan. The meeting will ask about the journeys people make, where you like to cycle - or not - and will explain what Space for Cycling means in real life. Details at: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1522822411281504/">www.facebook.com/events/1522822411281504</a>

Tea and coffee etc available. Meetings are usually followed by a social in a nearby pub.
