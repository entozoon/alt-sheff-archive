		<td>An evening of art, craft, music and discussion. Come and listen to guest speakers, Yorkshire Women’s Sound Network, Sandra Baker, Sheffield Steel Roller Girls, The Soroptomists, Amnesty International, The Sheffield Feminist Network and more talk about their campaigns and passions. Grab a drink and settle down to hear some fascinating talks or sign up to one of our open mic slots and join in!

Also a miniature version of Skull and Heart’s Hear Me Roar show with 20 prints from women artists available to view and buy. Or you can turn your hand to some body positive felting and badge making, or start your publishing career with some zine making with Chella Quint and Girl Gang Sheffield making Feminist Posters! The soundtrack to the evening will be provided by Sheffield natives The Seamonsters who’ll be playing live. 

The event is free, but donations are welcome on the door.
