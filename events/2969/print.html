		<td>40 years ago a military coup plunged Chile into a brutal right-wing dictatorship, the first country in the world to experience the shock of "neoliberalism". Many fled the country, some arriving here to make Sheffield their new home. 

Now, in commemoration of the anniversary, there is a series of events in happier times including this, Celebrating Life with a traditional community party, which continues until 11.50pm.
