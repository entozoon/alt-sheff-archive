		<td>Just a warning, if you're thinking about going to this "Green Economics Lecture", despite the name the School of Economic Science is basically religious - and more importantly it has been criticised as a cult. See Wikipedia. Anyway who holds green lectures at Meadowhall? Admission: £4 booked by phone, £5 on the door. Tel. Sheff 2880815 but our advice is don't get yourself indoctrinated AND ripped off</td>
