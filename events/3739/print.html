		<td>As people struggle to make ends meet, millionaire Gideon Osborne will yet again tell parliament on Wednesday that austerity is here to stay. In fact he will go even further than previously and announce that cuts be enshrined into law for the next few years.

We all know what this means:
* More food banks
* Tougher benefit sanctions
* Scapegoating of migrants
* Misery for thousands

Show your anger at the government - bring pots and pans/anything that makes lots of noise!

Local activists have been invited to speak.
