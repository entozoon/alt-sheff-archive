		<td>The Cuban Constitution was adopted in 1975, by a 98% "yes" vote on a 98% turnout. Does that make it democratic? In the constitution, the Communist Party is the only legal party and a "higher guiding force". Is that democratic? In Cuba, private capitalists have no power. Is that democratic? Before the 2011 Party Congress that adopted a new economic policy model for Cuba, 90% of the adult population participated in debates that amended two-thirds of Party proposals. Does participation equal democracy?

This public meeting with Arnold August, Canadian political scientist and author, journalist and lecturer is a rare opportunity to discuss such issues with an international authority. Arnold August is a regular visitor to Cuba who has studied Cuban democracy on the ground. All welcome.
