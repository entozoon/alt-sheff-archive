		<td>Disillusioned by a ‘civilised’ culture of consumption and alienation, a newly married couple set off on a year-long journey around the UK, searching for the seeds of an alternative culture and hope for the future. This is a film of their experience as they speak to grassroots activists alongside the pioneering voices of Satish Kumar (The Ecologist), Polly Higgins (Ecocide Lawyer), Mac Macartney (Embercombe), Bruce Parry (Explorer), Mark Boyle (Moneyless Manifesto), Martin Shaw (School of Myth), Glennie Kindred (Artist and writer), the late Patrick Whitefield (Permaculturist) and Simon Fairlie (The Land). The film trailer is <a href="http://www.wetheuncivilised.org/">online here</a>.

The film screening will be followed by a Q&A discussion. This is one of a programme of events at Regather. To book tickets in advance (£7/£5 concessions) see their website.
