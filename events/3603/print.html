		<td>The annual Autumn Show Fundraiser is back again with plenty to offer for all the family:- 

Make a scary Vegetable Monster – this can be entered into the produce show. Who has the largest onions and the longest runner bean? Bring your best home or allotment grown produce along to be judged by a VIP! (Entries must be brought in between 11am - 12noon to the double span Polytunnel on the Farm). Sheep Race – will your sheep be first back to the stables at tea time? Stalls – gift, food, community information and craft stalls to browse. Funky Face Painting, animal petting sessions in the Small Animal House, photos with animals – can be made into a keyring for you to keep. Heritage Activity, spinning fleece into wool from rare breed Whitefaced Woodland Sheep with members of the Hallamshire Guild of Weavers Spinners & Dyers. Children’s Autumn Crafts in the Energy Centre. Bongo Tribe Drumming Workshops. 

Free admission to the Farm. Any money raised from activities on the day will be used to help pay for animal care (for which the Farm receives no funding), projects with young people and adults with disabilities and learning difficulties.

Produce Show entry forms can be downloaded from the Farm website on the events tab. Contact for more details about the event <a href="mailto:s.hardy@heeleyfarm.org.uk">s.hardy@heeleyfarm.org.uk</a>, Sheff 2580482.
