		<td>Peace and reconciliation in the Great Lakes region of Africa. A discussion and screening of the film “Icyizere: Hope”

Last year Dave Zarembka and his wife Gladys Kimonya visited Sheffield to talk about the work of the African Great Lakes Initiative (AGLI) and Dave’s book: “A Peace of Africa: Reflections on Life in the Great Lakes Region”. This year, we have the privilege of welcoming Elizabeth Cave, a London Quaker who is working in Rwanda with AGLI.

Elizabeth will show pictures and discuss AGLI’s trauma healing programme, which has been developed in Rwanda and Burundi. She speaks from first hand experience after running a project in Rwanda called “Growing Together” to encourage groups who took part in HROC (Healing and Rebuilding our Communities) or a similar process to grow vegetables together, using organic methods and encouraging greater variety in their diets.

Elizabeth will introduce a film by Patrick Mureithi, “Icyizere: Hope” which looks at a HROC workshop in Gisenyi Friends Church near Lake Kivu. This powerful film has been shown all over the world and has been viewed widely in Rwanda, including a screening for inmates in Gisenyi Central prison where one of the films’s subjects was imprisoned for his crimes during the genocide.

There is no entrance fee or need to reserve a place. Just turn up!
