		<td>The Sheffield Esteli sponsored bike ride raises money for educational and ennvironmental projects in Esteli in Nicaragua, one of the poorest countries in the world and with one of the largest gaps between rich and poor. The ride starts between 8am and 9am from Endcliffe Park (normally an open tent pitched on the access road below the junction of Ecclesall Road and Rustlings Road). Probably too late to enter now, but support and sponsorship is important.
