		<td>The cultural boycott is growing rapidly and recently Gil Scott Heron agreed to cancel his concert in Israel. There are currently new campaigns to call on Joan Armatrading and Elvis Costello not to perform in Israel this June. Joan is currently touring and protestors will be leafleting outside  all her concerts. She is performing in Buxton on Tuesday 11th May and Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign plans to be there. Email <a href="mailto:boycottisraeligoods@live.co.uk">boycottisraeligoods@live.co.uk</a> if you can come and they will sort out transport.
