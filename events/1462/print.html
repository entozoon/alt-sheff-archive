		<td>The international annual day to raise awareness of the impact of prejudice and discrimination on the health and wellbeing of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people, and their families, friends and colleagues. Come and make some noise to speak out and say that homophobia and transphobia have no place in our society. A number of key speakers will pledge their support, then, at 6pm ... the one-minute noise!
