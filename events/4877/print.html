		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Every December, Amnesty supporters across the globe will write millions of letters for people whose basic human rights are being attacked. It’s all part of Write for Rights, the global letter-writing marathon. It’s one of the world’s biggest human rights events and carries on a long tradition of people like you writing letters to right some of the world’s biggest wrongs. 

Sheffield Amnesty International group will be at Weston Park Museum on the 10th December (Human Rights Day) so please come down, bring the family and help make some greeting cards that will be sent to those people who are suffering human rights violations. They will provide the materials, all they need is your artistic skills and they will send the cards all around the world.
