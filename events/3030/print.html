		<td>Sheffield’s 5th Palestinian Film festival. A collaboration between <a href="http://www.sheffieldpsc.org.uk/">Sheffield Palestinian Solidarity Campaign</a>, <a href="http://www.ypce.org.uk/">Yorkshire Palestine Cultural Exchange</a> and the <a href="http://www.showroom.org.uk/">Showroom Cinema</a>. 

"In the midst of the war of 1948, which Palestinians call the Naqba (Catastrophe) and Israelis call the War of Independence, future Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion plotted the blossoming nation’s course: “We must do everything to ensure they [the Palestinians] never return.” He predicted, “The old will die and the young will forget.” By the time Golda Meir had assumed Ben-Gurion’s position, virulent honesty had given way to dissimulation (or self-deception): “How can we return the occupied territories?” asked the silver-haired “Iron Lady” of Israeli politics. “There is nobody to return them to.” Since 1948, Palestinians have not only occupied the painful position of many oppressed peoples who are systematically displaced, disenfranchised, denationalized, brutalized and murdered; they have also been put in the awkward, even tragicomic, position of having to convince the rest of the world of their very existence. This problem of visibility lies at the heart of Dreams of a Nation: On Palestinian Cinema" (Full review <a href="http://electronicintifada.net/content/requesting-permission-narrate-dreams-nation-reviewed/3512">here</a>)

Cinema Palestino this year includes "When I Saw You", the  latest film by contributor to this book, Annemarie Jacir.

Also "When the boys return", a film following 12 teenage boys in a therapy programme at the YMCA in Hebron, West Bank, after being released from Israeli prisons.
