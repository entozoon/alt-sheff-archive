		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Famous singer Engelbert Humperdinck is currently on a world tour that includes City Hall Sheffield, on November 5th, and Tel Aviv on December 1st. His full tour includes 16 gigs in the UK and Ireland. There are already protests planned in in Bristol, London and Dublin. Engelbert has been known to actively oppose racism, maybe the boycotts will get him to see that playing Tel Aviv is in fact an act of support for the apartheid Israeli state.

If you would like to join the protest in Sheffield please contact the boycott group or join them on the steps of the City Hall.
