		<td>Meeting open to the public on how Humanists mark the major points in our lives. Brief and sometimes light-hearted outline of what a Humanist ceremony is, how and why people choose them, how they work - including best and worst moments! The law, national and local trends and a Humanist perspective on the Death and Wedding Industries. With celebrants Ann Granville and Matthew Simpson. Your own experiences of all types of ceremonies, together with your curiosity, will make for a lively session.</td>
