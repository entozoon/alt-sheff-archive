		<td>Two days of training, equipping you with the skills to protect yourself and your fellow workers, covering workplace law and the best ways to organise at work. 

The IWW (International Workers of the World) is a radical, grassroots union that can trace its history back to 1905, and has a membership all over the globe, from Chicago to Paris to Tyneside. As well as being a union in its own right, it also welcomes those who are members of other unions and has a long productive history of dual card membership, allowing trade unionists to connect with others, across the labour movement.

As a grassroots organisation, IWW has always been dedicated to supplying open training, for the membership at large, not just a handful of representatives. These sessions aren't just for those new to the labour movement, but also those who may simply want to help our or brush up. The classes will be led by tutors from around the country, with a variety of experiences. Food and drink are available throughout the event.
