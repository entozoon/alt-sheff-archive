		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A meeting to formally set up a Sheffield and South Yorkshire branch of Liberty, to campaign on human rights and civil liberties. It will be a basic organisational framework, regular meetings, and co-operation where possible with other bodies (eg. Amnesty, Sheffield Justice for All, students, political parties, trade unions, religious and community groups, organisations working with and for refugees and asylum seekers).

To discuss how best to put these ideas into practice, please come along and take part in planning what the group can do over the next six months, which may include plans for International Human Rights Day, and inviting speakers to public meetings. 

Part of the meeting will cover "Closed Material Procedures", the government proposal to allow the introduction in court of evidence that is kept secret from the defendant - a blatant breach of the right to a fair trial. The discussion will be led by a local barrister or solicitor.

Ideas welcome, you do not have to be a member of Liberty nationally to take part - although in time they might encourage you to join!

If you cannot make it but are interested in joining later, please email <a href="mailto:michaelmccolgan@phonecoop.coop">michaelmccolgan@phonecoop.coop</a> or <a href="caritaruththomas%40yahoo.co.html">caritaruththomas@yahoo.co.uk</a> or tel. Sheff 2685721</td>
