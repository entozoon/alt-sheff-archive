		<td>Abbeydale Grange School faces closure. The Liberal Democrat Cabinet makes the decision on 9th December. We must act, and act now! Following the 21 Nov. protest march this open public debate about the future of the School is between 3 of the parliamentary candidates for Central Ward.

Please bring as many friends and supporters of the school as you can as the more people we have there, the more impact we will have.

Abbeydale Grange has a reputation for offering a welcoming place for students whose families have come to Britain to escape persecution. The school has pupils from over 100 countries, with over fifty-five languages spoken. It offers places for children who have had difficulty coping with their previous schools. Some new arrivals not only have no English language, but have never attended school. Its pupils have made remarkable achievementsâ€”academically, in sport, the arts, science and the media.

Please write to the Cabinet Members at Sheffield Town Hall or email them at the addresses below to express your support for the school staying open.
