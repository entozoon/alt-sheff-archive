		<td>All are warmly invited to come along to this intro night, a chance to learn about what Sheffield Renewables is up to and to find out about volunteering opportuntities for this exciting, practical project. 

They could particularly do with recruiting a few people interested in communications, digital media and organising local events. No need to register in advance, just come along. It'll be a relaxed intro - you won't be put under any pressure to commit to things on the night.
