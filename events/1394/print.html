		<td>Inspired by the 2011 waves of student protests and activism, Sheffield Universal Education Collective was formed to provide a free, radical, open and democratic education space in the city, with sessions that critically think about the world around us and explore means to change it.

Colin Waugh will be talking about his recently published account of the Plebs League â€“ the founding movement inspired by the notion that the working classes should produce their own thinkers and organisers! It eventually became a national movement, in which tens of thousands of working-class people both taught and learnt. Autobiographies and reminiscences of many labour movement leaders in the 1930s, 40s and 50s refer to it.
