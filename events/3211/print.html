		<td>WDM meeting which will include plans for the "Whose Food?" event (see Sat. 15th Feb), and planning activities for the period after that. 

           WDM aims to change the actions, policies and institutions of governments, corporations and wealthy minorities, which are preventing an end to poverty and injustice. Part of a global movement, it works alongside people protesting in the developing world. 

Meetings usually followed by informal gathering in the nearby <i>Church House</i> pub, approx. 9.15-10.15pm. If you plan to come only to the pub then please contact so someone can meet you, (phone 07800 666553 or leave a message at the QMH), as occasionally the group does not go to the pub.
