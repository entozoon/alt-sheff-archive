		<th>Details</th>
		<td>First bus drivers are striking because the company is treating them as it has treated passengers - with contempt. Good public transport is key to a clean environment but the current privatized, deregulated system is reducing trust in bus services, not increasing it.

This meeting is open to all, and a number of speakers are being invited. Refreshments provided.
