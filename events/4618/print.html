		<td>A weekend of free activities across four venues showcasing the amazingly diverse craftsmanship skills providing livelihoods in Sheffield city centre. Find out how craftsmanship offers a satisfying living, and how you can learn or make a start. Hands-on activity of traditional and digital making for adults and children. Part of Sheffield‘s Year of Making to celebrate all that Ruskin admired about the ‘hand-power‘ and ‘heart-passion‘ of craftsmanship and how it helps make better lives.  

There is a listing of the events and activities, download the brochure <a href="http://www.ruskininsheffield.com/download/i/mark_dl/u/4012445474/4627754601/RinS 2016 PDF.pdf">here</a>.
