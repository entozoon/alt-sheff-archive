		<td>The World Development Movement (WDM) is a UK-based anti-poverty organisation which campaigns for justice for the worldâ€™s poor, people before profit, and a sustainable world. It aims to change the actions, policies and institutions of governments, corporations and wealthy minorities, which are preventing an end to poverty and injustice. WDM works alongside people in the developing world, who are standing up to injustice. 

The Sheffield group is part of a global movement. Together with 60 other local groups and national WDM they have a real impact, including recent legislative alterations curbing financial speculation in prices of essential foods.
