		<td>SYMAAG unites refugee, asylum and migrant organisations with campaign groups and supporting individuals. It campaigns both for the rights of those seeking asylum and of those coming to work in this country. 

This month: guest speaker from Sheffield Libyan community. The uprising against the Libyan dictatorship has resulted in real hardship for migrant workers trying to leave Libya (mainly to Tunisia); an increase in the number of refugees from Libya and fear for Libyan exiles and students in the UK - one Libyan asylum seeker in Sheffield explained to SYMAAG that he was under threat of deportation to Libya (presumably the UK Borders Agency regards Libya as 'safe').

A speaker from the Libyan community will lead a discussion about the fight against dictatorship; the rights of Libyan refugees and migrant workers in the country; the history of co-operation between European government and Gaddafi in trying to stop immigration from Africa to Europe and what we can do to support the rights of refugees and migrant workers here and in Libya.
