		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A demonstration against the renewal of Trident nuclear missiles ahead of the vote, which will be happening across the country. Nuclear weapons are illegal in international law, immoral, unwanted by a majority of the population, and disgustingly expensive "toys for the boys". Bring placards, banners, etc. 

On the same day there will be a national demonstration in London, with a march and rally in Trafalgar Square to send a powerful message to the government. It has been called by CND (Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament) supported by the Stop the War Coalition, Muslim Association of Britain and the Peopleâ€™s Assembly, with more organisations pledging support all the time. Transport to London will be available through Yorkshire CND, picking up from Meadowhall. For details on how to book a seat, contact <a href="mailto:scraptridentnow@gmail.com">scraptridentnow@gmail.com</a>
