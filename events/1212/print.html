		<td>Social Centre group day event from approx 11 till 4. The purpose is to choose the form of co-operative structure and registration, a bank account, and to begin to look at available properties. Everyone is welcome to hear and discuss plans for future activities, don’t worry if you haven’t been before, newcomers welcome.

Sheffield Social Centre is a collective for libertarian DIY space in the city. If you're interested you're very welcome  - the project is open to all who share its core principles of non-hierarchy, anti-capitalism and equality/non-discrimination.

Bring-and-share vegan food.

Note: Venue: Sharrow Junior School - the old one on South View Rd. not the new one in Mount Pleasant.
