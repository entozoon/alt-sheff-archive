		<td>In recent years skepticism has established a definite presence in the public domain and the media. Those involved often refer to themselves as ‘skeptics’, signifying that they support critical and scientific thinking and oppose the promotion of irrational, supernatural and unscientific ideas, claims and practices. Must a skeptic be an atheist? Or is it possible for someone who is committed to a religion also to be ‘a skeptic’? Everyone is welcome to join in a lively and friendly debate on this question.

 Skeptics in the Pub events are free though they ask for a £2 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
