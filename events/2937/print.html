		<th>Details</th>
		<td>St. Mark’s Centre for Radical Christianity invites you to “Just” Economics. This is a conference with Ann Pettifor, an internationally respected economist and an excellent speaker. She argues that in relation to the current financial crisis, austerity measures are not needed, will not work and are undoubtedly unjust. The economy must serve human need rather than human needs being sacrificed to a one-eyed and amoral view of economics.<br>
