		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Based in Sheffield and originally released in 1984, this film has been described in The Guardian as "one of the most harrowing things ever to air on television ... an unremittingly bleak and entirely plausible account of nuclear war and its aftermath".

Shown as part of <a href="http://2014.sensoria.org.uk/events/">Sensoria</a>, the festival of music, film and digital. Please note: Wrap up warm. October nights can get chilly. Bring blankets and cushions, as the seating at the amphitheatre can get cold, so bring something to sit on, food and drink and hot flasks of drinks or soup etc (no glass please). There will be stands selling hot drinks as well as a licensed bar. £10 deposit per person for headphones. £6 advance, £10 door.
