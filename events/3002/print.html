		<td>Green City Action Tool Bank aims to provide affordable tools for people living in S3, S4 and S5 post code areas to help them maintain their homes and gardens. They have painting and decorating, plastering, cleaning and car and bike maintenance tools as well as personal protective equipment. Part-week hire costs £1 - £15 depending on tool type. A deposit of £5 - £20 is returned in full when the tool is returned on time and in good condition.

After a sporadic service over the last decade, Awards for All (Big Lottery Fund) has provided funding to guarantee the service until March 2014 and they are trying to develop the service so that it can have a stable future. Green City Action is an established and award winning environmental charity, based in Burngreave and serving the surrounding area.

For more information, including an inventory of the tools they supply visit the website <a href="http://www.gca.burngreave.net/">www.gca.burngreave.net</a> Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GreenCityAction">www.facebook.com/GreenCityAction</a>, tel Sheff 2440353 or call in when Tool Bank is open.</td>
