<strong>Guest speaker: Becki Cox, Principal Technical Advisor at Living Streets.</strong>

Cycle Sheffield is the campaign for a cycle-friendly Sheffield, where <strong>anyone</strong> can choose to make their journey by bike - for cycling to be inclusive and easy, not limited to the quick and the brave! It is the voice of people in Sheffield who want their city to provide active transport options with freedom to get around by bike. Cycle Sheffield discusses and responds to planning issues which affect transport and cycling, assessing them and (where needed and possible) proposing alternative solutions.  

New members are always welcome.

The Annual Report is available on the link below.
