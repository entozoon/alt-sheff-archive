		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The Leveson Enquiry was established in July 2011 and since then has been a constant source of controversy and rarely out of the news. Most recently, there is the disagreement between (and within) the Government and others about the basis for future press regulation. Jeremy Clifford, editor of the Sheffield Star and Sheffield Telegraph, will disentangle some of the Leveson issues and offer his perspective as a local news editor.

Admission: Â£4. One of many events which are part of Broomhill Festival.
