		<td>Mike Granville, Sheffield Humanist Society on the Fair Admissions Campaign. If a state school is designated as "a school with a religious character" it is exempt from the requirement not to discriminate on grounds of religion or belief in relation to admissions even though that school may be funded entirely through general taxation. This means that admissions criteria may give preference to members of a religion. Is this fair?

A talk open to the public, organised by the Sheffield Humanist Society, all welcome.
