		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Organised by the African Sexual Health Peer Education Project, this event will bring together people from the diverse range of African communities in Sheffield to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS. Following the success of previous years, the event is expanded with discussions and workshops on the issues affecting our communities as well as some fun and exciting African drum and dance workshops. An opportunity to meet, raise awareness, network, and identify future developments in the field of HIV awareness. A free lunch from the wonderful SADACCA kitchen will also be provided. This is expected to be a hugely popular event with a limited number of places available, so book early to avoid disappointment.
