		<td>Assemble outside Marks and Spencers on Fargate for a Sheffield boycott march as part of the international protest on Palestinian Land Day - commemorating the murder of Palestinians involved in the struggle to keep their own land. 

A 'crocodile march' round the city centre, stopping and leafleting outside stores who are complicit in Israel's crimes. 

If you have Boycott Israeli Goods tee-shirts please wear them (or you can buy one on the day if you'd like one). Plenty of people needed to hold the long boycott banner and to help with leafletting. If you can't get there as early as 4.30 p.m. please come when you can - outside Marks and Spencers and H & M (both Fargate) for the first half hour.
