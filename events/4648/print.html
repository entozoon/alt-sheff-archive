		<td>AFC Unity are a Sheffield based indie women's football club and also a not-for-profit community organisation. We are currently running our Football for Food campaign where we collect food at our home games and events to then distribute via Sheffield Food Collective to local food banks. You can read more about the campaign here: https://afcunity.org/football-for-food/ 

As part of our expanding Football for Food campaign AFC Unity will be running a pop-up stall at Devonshire Green on the 19th of June, 10am-6pm where we will have donation buckets/containers to encourage donations of food for food banks we are working with via Sheffield Food Collective, with a stall with information about the campaign (via leaflets), whilst players from our 11-a-side kick a ball about together. Players will be sponsored with food to do the event from their friends and family too. 

Please support in whatever way you can!</td>
