		<td>Rising to the challenge of climate change is a big idea for 2014, we must turn the greatest collective challenge facing humankind today into the greatest opportunity for common progress towards a sustainable future, says Ban Ki Moon, UN secretary general. This discussion is led by Suzanne Jeffrey from the National Campaign against Climate Change. 

It is time to act! Can Sheffield take a leading role? The alternative to climate chaos starts with building a movement from below. All progressive changes in society have been brought about through movements of people, creating a massive groundswell. Think of the civil rights movement in the States, the abolition of slavery and apartheid and the winning of rights for women. The Time to Act! Campaign sets out to build a base, aiming to bring the political pressure needed to commit Government and the European Commission to a carbon-free future. Go out and argue the climate case and build local climate alliances.
