		<td><b>Peace in the Park 2013 has been postponed until June 2014,  due to the problems of fundraising in the current tough economic climate, central government cuts, the increased costs of living and declining incomes.  </b> 

This is a great disappointment for the city, but Peace in the Park will be back. Presumably this first public meeting since the tough decision was taken will be a time to share ideas and to volunteer for the re-launch next year.
