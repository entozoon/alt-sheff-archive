		<th>Details</th>
		<td>More fun for a great cause. The Peace in the Park festival promotes peace and understanding by bringing together communities through artistic, musical and vocal expression. Peace in the Park is organised by a voluntary group of artists, musicians, students, events organisers and other everyday Sheffield folk, working together in a not for profit collective. It costs around £8,000 to stage the festival, so fund-raisers like this are vital.

£5 admission. All profits to PITP!
