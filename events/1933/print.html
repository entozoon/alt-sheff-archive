		<td>An unmissable, ever-growing Sheffield tradition, the 9th annual Sharrow Lantern Carnival, and the theme this year is magic! Hundreds of hand-made lanterns of all sizes will be on display, along with fire spinners, musical acts, and over 3000 people parading through the streets, led by Sheffield Samba Band. 

Meet 7.30pm to set off at 8pm from Mount Pleasant Park (Sharrow Lane, near London Rd. S11 8AE).

The parade tours the streets of the Sharrow area of Sheffield, before finally leading to a celebration with live music and more fun at Sheffield General Cemetery 9-10pm.
