		<td>Learn about the rich history of the iconic Sheffield co-operative department store, now sadly closed. In 1964 Castle House was officially opened by Brightside and Carbrook Co-operative, supported by 106,000 cooperative members. With a food hall, clothing, furniture, flooring, offices and a restaurant, this for many working class people was the ultimate shopping experience, and member-owned rather than capitalist.

The building is open daily 10.30am-5pm. Tours daily at 2pm can be booked at the Castle House information desk (open 10.30-5pm).
