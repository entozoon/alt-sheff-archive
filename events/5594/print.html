According to Haaretz, the expected number of Eurovision tourists has been cut from 18000 to 10000 citing lack of funding resulting in higher ticket prices as the cause of this - no mention of European wide campaigns calling for people not to attend! Israel is using Eurovision to promote itself as "the only democracy in the Middle East" while its apartheid policies continue to deny human rights to 5 million Palestinians.
