		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A day of solidarity and action at the gates of Misson Springs Shale Gas Exploration Site to highlight the signing of the 2016 Paris Agreement on climate change. This agreement binds 195 nations to an increase in the global average temperature to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. Processes such as fracking fly in the face of this agreement.

 <a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/groups/FrackFreeMisson/">Frack Free Misson</a> will fill the road with people and send a message to our government and support this community which faces possible fracking. They will have music, speakers, cake and hopefully beautiful sunshine. Misson is some miles east of Sheffield, past Bawtry. Details at the link below.
