		<td>Ronald Green, on why should nothing matter? If anything matters, why should nothing matter? And yet it does, for there isnt anything, it seems, that nothing does not touch, or anything that does not touch nothing. History, philosophy, religion, science, art, literature, music all look towards nothing at some point, stimulating questions that would otherwise not be asked. Ronald Green uses nothing in a genuine attempt to look at the world in a different way, to give new angles to old problems and so to stimulate new thoughts.

Ronald Green is the author of Nothing Matters  a book about nothing (iff-Books). Philosopher, linguist, university lecturer and ESL teacher, with 13 ESL books published, Ronald has lectured and given workshops in Europe, North and South America and the Middle East on linguistics, ESL and the use of the Internet in education.
