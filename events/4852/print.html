		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Sheffield Trades Council is the city’s local TUC, bringing together trade union branches and members from all sectors, the progressive voice of Sheffield’s Trade Union movement. Guest Speakers: 

Eileen Turnbull – Shrewsbury 24 Campaign. 24 pickets were arrested after the 1972 national building workers strike and charged with conspiracy. Some including Ricky Tomlinson and Des Warren were jailed. The call for justice is as relevant today as it was then.

David Etherington – Austerity and Devolution. David presents the major findings of his research into the effects on local communities of a City Region Devolution deal that devolves central government’s austerity spending cuts onto our local government structures.

Sheffield Needs a Pay Rise campaign update.

Visitors/observers welcome. Please register at the door (side entrance on Talbot Street).
