		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The Green Spaces Forum, this month the agenda includes an update on the Parks Insurance Scheme. If anyone has any good news from their group or events to promote and share, please get in touch and they will allocate a time slot for you in the meeting (usually about 3 minutes). Refreshments provided.

Inside the venue it is in Room 13:17 Floor 13. The Arts Tower is also accessible from Bolsover Street, S3 7NA. Please note, visitor parking is no longer available in the Arts Tower car park and fines will be issued for those parking without permits. Blue badge holders can park in the Geography and Planning building car park which is on Winter Street, S3 7ND. For non-blue badge holders, there are two options: in the Durham Street car park behind the Students’ Union building, S10 2JA (a Q-car park, so is expensive and would be a good 5 minute walk to the Arts Tower) or cheaper option is on-road parking, on Bolsover Street - from 6.30pm the bus lane is no longer ‘active’ so you can park there, or Mushroom Lane, S3 7NZ.</td>
