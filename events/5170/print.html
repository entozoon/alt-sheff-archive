		<td>Fundraising event for Love Music Hate Racism Sheffield. This is a small start to what is hoped will build into a great campaign running regular music events around the city. Supporting local musicians, spreading a message of anti-racism & supporting other local anti-racism campaigns. To be able to run bigger events in future, they need to raise funds.

Free entry, suggested a donation of about Â£3 (or more) to support the campaign, if you can spare it. There will be food, music, speakers from the campaign and a silent auction. Nice T-Shirts for sale too.

Bands confirmed so far:
