Abbeydale Grange has a reputation for offering a welcoming place for students whose families have come to Britain to escape persecution. The school has pupils from over 100 countries, with over fifty-five languages spoken. It offers places for children who have had difficulty coping with their previous schools. Some new arrivals not only have no English language, but have never attended school. Its pupils have made remarkable achievements—academically, in sport, the arts, science and the media.
