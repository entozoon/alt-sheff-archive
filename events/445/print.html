Sheffield Local Exchange and Trading System - <b>LETS</b> for short,  is a network of like minded people interested in trading goods and services for a virtual currency called <b>'Stones'</b>.  This not-for-profit group gives you the opportunity to trade your skills, local produce and unwanted items without the need for cash. Currently 60 members from all parts of Sheffield offer a wide variety of things from language tuition to cat sitting, plants to computer skills, alternative therapies to proofreading.

The system can be described as a 'merry-go-round' of favours but unlike bartering, the trade does not have to be a two-way swap.
