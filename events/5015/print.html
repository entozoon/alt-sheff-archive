		<td>There has been a political earthquake erupting across the globe.  There is a refugee crisis, Islamophobia is intensifying and the election of Donald Trump poses a serious threat to any progress towards peace. The general election here in the UK brings important questions about foreign policy to the fore. 

The recent national conference​ of Stop the War decided it will work to inform people about the record of the pro-war parties, whose militarist and interventionist policies have caused so much suffering, death and destruction at home and abroad. In order to help voters make an informed choice on 8 June, they agreed to produce and publish materials which reveal where the different political actors stand on issues​ of​ war and peace.

Sheffield Stop the War Coalition are holding this meeting to give a report back from the National Conference and discuss strategy and upcoming activity in Sheffield. It will also be a timely opportunity to talk about the general election and how we can ensure that the anti-war agenda is debated.

It is likely that Stop the War will need to mobilise over the coming weeks in response to the issues raised above. Please come along to this meeting to find out how you can help.</td>
