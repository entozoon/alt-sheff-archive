		<td>People seeking asylum are usually not allowed to work while the Home Office processes their asylum application. As many of us know, this can take years. <b><a href="https://cityofsanctuary.org/2018/09/18/lift-the-ban-local-activism-pack/">Lift the Ban</a></b> is a new national campaign which seeks to win the right of people seeking asylum to work. SYMAAG (South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group) is one its members. At the moment Lift The Ban are asking for testimonies from people denied the right to work - you can download an information pack at the link above.

To help campaign effectively for asylum seekers´ right to work, this free training has been organised by Everyday Activism. This is an introductory session. Please contact SYMAAG if you are interested. They can pay reasonable travel expenses. All are welcome, whether it´s your first campaign or not, whether you have been active in the UK or in your country of origin. It´s open to all, not only people seeking asylum. They would particularly welcome trade unionists. Already Barnsley have declared themselves a Trades Council of Sanctuary, and hopefully others will follow.
