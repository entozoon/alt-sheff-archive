		<td>Sleep Paralysis is a condition of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep in which one becomes conscious of surroundings during the night, but is unable to move. These experiences are often accompanied by a wide range of bizarre and often terrifying hallucinations. Throughout history, many ostensibly paranormal experiences may be explained as episodes of sleep paralysis, including middle ages accounts of attacks by sex crazed demons, supposed "evidence" used to prosecute witches, and more recently, claims of alien abduction. The talk will also examine the research carried out by anthropologists, psychologists, and neuroscientists to try and better understand the causes of sleep paralysis episodes.

Speaker Daniel Denis is a PhD student at the University of Sheffield and former researcher in the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmiths where he carried out research into the causes of and risk factors involved in sleep paralysis. He is also the resident researcher for the Sleep Paralysis Project, a multi-disciplinary investigation into sleep paralysis. 

Skeptics in the Pub events are free though they ask for a Â£3 donation, and the meetings are open to all.
