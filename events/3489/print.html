		<td>Informed debate in a special joint Workers Educational Association (WEA) and Talkshop event, led by Perry Walker and Martin Yarnit using the Crowd Wise format - an ideal tool for developing viable policy options. Explore the impact of inequality in Britain which has never been so extreme since the 1930s.  It doesn′t have to be like this – so what can we do to return those post-war years when wealth and income was more fairly distributed?

This event will give you the opportunity to consider each of several options and discuss their pros and cons, with basic information in the form of one page descriptions of a policy option.

Tea and coffee provided. A free event, but places are limited, booking by 25th June tel Sheff 2423609 or email <a href="mailto:rwells@wea.org.uk">rwells@wea.org.uk</a></td>
