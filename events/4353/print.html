		<td>Offering more than just books, this is the 7th annual bookfair in Sheffield. It includes workshops and film screenings, and is followed by an evening social. It brings together from around the country radical booksellers, distributors, independent presses and political groups. There are also events leading up to the weekend.

The word ‘anarchism’ is a bit scary to some people, but bookfairs are part of an international, living tradition of libertarian socialism. This advocates freedom through the organisation of a democratic and equal society based on systems of mutual solidarity, controlled from below, not from above. Self-managed and co-operative industries from Spain to Argentina are examples, and anarchists are involved in many struggles of workers, migrants, landless peoples, prisoners, etc.

Entrance free. Refreshments for sale in the foyer. Full programme of events available on the website in the weeks before the bookfair.
