		<td>Here’s Looking at UKIP is a show about an identity crisis, what it means to be British, a patriot, a small nation with a brutal past and an uncertain future. Is Great Britain really all that great? Is it OK to be proud of the British Empire? Can you love a country that does not love you back? An unflinching, funny, furious look at Britain’s problems with “foreigners”, historical amnesia and delusions of grandeur, to try and figure out how we got here - and where we’re going next.
