		<td>SYMAAG unites refugee, asylum and migrant organisations with campaign groups and supporting individuals. It campaigns both for the rights of those seeking asylum and of those coming to work in this country. 

SYMAAG maintain the view that G4S are prison guards not landlords. Their record is one of abuse towards asylum seekers in this country and elsewhere. We should not be paying them public money to operate the housing contract. People seeking asylum have the same rights to decent social housing as anyone else in this country.

If you want to come to any SYMAAG meeting but find it hard to afford transport do not be put off!  Please bring your ticket or a receipt and SYMAAG can pay you back at the meeting. Or check in advance.
