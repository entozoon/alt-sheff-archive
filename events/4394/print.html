		<td>In the spirit of DIY and spring cleaning, dozens of homes around Nether Edge open their gardens for this neighbourhood-wide equivalent of a car boot sale. It costs Â£5 per address to sell stuff, if you live around Nether Edge. See the website, which includes a map (that gets more and more venues nearer to the date).
