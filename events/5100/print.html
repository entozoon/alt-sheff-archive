		<td>Developing discussions of how utopian thinking might be useful in our personal and political lives today.

In preparation for his workshop and in the spirit of collaborative, collective learning, a bit of utopian re-framing is required; please take an aspect of your work/family/social/political life and begin thinking about how this could be done differently. Taking your own values, ethics, motivations as a starting point, how might this aspect of life be redesigned? This could be considering an alternative to your journey to work each day, for instance, thinking about how travel, the use of space, and the working day might be redesigned. You might want to think about the campaigns you’re involved in: how is organising conducted and would the dynamics, roles, communication look different if they were based on your ethics and values? To engage in the imaginative act of re-framing a significant aspect of our lives, share this re-framing and explain the values underpinning it, will begin to move conversations towards applied utopian thinking and start touching on many vital questions, themes and issues.

This is utopian re-framing on a very small scale. It will not come up with a shared vision of an entire alternative society in the first few meetings. This is going to be a process, and the process has to start somewhere. This follows a workshop on 25th May, but if you could not make the first event, don’t worry, you’ll be welcomed at this one. Hosted by former Sheffield Live presenter Max Munday. Note the venue is the Showroom cinema Cafe (through the bar).
