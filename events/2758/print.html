		<td>According to <a href="http://forgetoday.com/news/edl-call-off-saturdays-march/">Forge Today</a> Yorkshire EDL (English Defence League) plans to meet at the Walkabout pub in Sheffield city centre at 12pm and lay flowers at the war memorial at 1pm in memory of soldier Lee Rigby, who was murdered in London. 

A Facebook group called Protest Against EDL Sheffield had been set up to oppose a previously rumoured march from Meadowhall to Sheffield, stoking hatred and racism in our multicultural city.

At Barkers Pool from 12 noon everyone is invited to join in a peaceful gathering called by One Sheffield Many Cultures and Sheffield Unite Against Fascism.
