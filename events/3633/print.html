		<td>OPERA (Open Public Experimental Residential Activity) is a <a href="http://www.studiopolpo.com/">Studio Polpo</a> led initiative exploring the intersections of art, performance and living. During the Festival of the Mind Bazaar OPERA will inhabit part of Castle House in Sheffield city centre (the former Sheffield Co-operative department store). They will install temporary eating, living, sleeping and washing facilities and open this experimental residential space to invited guests and members of the public. 

Each evening residents of the &#39;Castle House&#39; will share a meal, discuss city centre collective living and stay the night.
