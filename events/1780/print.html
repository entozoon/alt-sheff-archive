		<td>Situation Architecture Film event located in a disused post-industrial space just South of Kelham Island and Horseman Works, to explore the issue of appropriating coexisting temporalities. 

The screening and its location is there to act as a catalyst to discussions on the film to be screened; Tarkovsky&#39;s &#39;Stalker&#39;, 1979. Audio from the evening will be recorded and feature in a transcript of some of the explorations from the evening&#39;s events, which will try to uncover the mechanisms through which these spaces are appropriated, up to a point of re-activating the notion of belonging. If this aim is achieved, is this re-activation an act of sensibly remembering the invisible qualities of space and perceptually understanding coexisting temporalities? Or is it simply a lived reality, which constantly reiterates itself?
