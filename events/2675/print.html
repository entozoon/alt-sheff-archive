		<td>You are invited to ‘Question Time’ with Ben Dyson, founder of Positive Money. They haven’t got David Dimbleby, but can still promise you a stimulating evening of questions and answers! What is the future direction for the Positive Money campaign, both nationally and locally? What don’t you understand about the proposed reforms? What don’t you agree with?

Members of the Sheffield support group will be putting their toughest questions to Ben, and there will also be plenty of opportunity for contributions and questions from the floor. Free (donation)
