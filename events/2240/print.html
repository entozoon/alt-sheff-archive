		<td>Public meeting to discuss what the new family migration rules mean and how to oppose them.

Major changes in family immigration rules came intoforce on 9 July. These rules mean that only people who earn at least £18,600 per year can bring their spouses to join them in the UK – and this increases to £22,400 for a child, and £2,400 for each additional child. Spouses of UK citizens must now wait 5 years before they can apply for indefinite leave to remain – and during this time, they cannot receive benefits. Spouses of UK citizens will have to pass an intermediate English test AND the Life in the UK test in order to settle in the UK. It is much easier to deport the parent of a British child, even if this means a permanent separation. 

Speakers from Migrant Rights Network, SYMAAG and from communities directly by the rule changes.
