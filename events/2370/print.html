		<td>Sheffield Babel Songs is a community group that collects and shares songs and memories about them, from Sheffield&#39;s international population. This concert is to raise funds to produce a songbook of the material the group has collected, which will then be cheaply available to local choirs, schools and musicians. The final hour will be an open jam session, so anyone wishing to sing, bring and instrument and join in is most welcome!

Advance tickets £5/£4 concession, £7 on the door. Bar and refreshments availiable.</td>
