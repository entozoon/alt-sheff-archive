		<td>On Valentines Day a series of protests in Sheffield will start with a bang on Fargate. You are invited to make a noise about tax, lobbying parties to introduce a tax dodging bill. Bring pots, pans, instrument of any kind to make some noise about tax dodging. Or bring along a sign that says what you think about tax avoidance and creating a fairer society. Or say why you totally love companies who pay their taxes! 
 
In the run-up to the election, protests will be held at various tax dodgers across the city. They&#39;d love to see you there :)
