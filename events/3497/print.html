		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. This time, for everyone fed up with criticism about the Tour de France: "Route Dressing". On the route through Southey, Parkwood Springs, Burngreave, Newhall, Grimesthorpe, Wincobank and Attercliffe, come and help to tie gold/yellow ribbons around every post on the route. Bring scissors and enthusiasm,  ribbon/yellow tape if you can but there will be materials. Lots of people needed, there were 60 on the last ride.
