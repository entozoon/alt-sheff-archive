		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. Their motto? "We have nothing to lose but our chains!" (But bring locks and lights too, just in case). As usual this one is something a bit different. There is no definite route.  There will be locations to visit in Heeley and things to find out, deduce, collect or record.  (Pens will be provided!)  Turn up for a 6.30 start, collect a map of the locations, and ride around matching, discovering, deducing, guessing, collecting and recording. You can do it in as big or small a group as you like. There will be prizes. A map of the locations will be available on the night and put up on the web after the event.  Routes can be plotted after the event and there will be a prize for the shortest route. Food and some drink (bring a bottle) and music provided at 9pm, when hopefully you come back! If it is wet then just come for the social at 9. Many thanks to ReCycleBikes for supporting Sheffield FNR and the use of the space. This ride will NOT be advertised on the website or Facebook or Twitter.
