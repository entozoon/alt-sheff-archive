		<td>WDM aims to change the actions, policies and institutions of governments, corporations and wealthy minorities, which are preventing an end to poverty and injustice. Part of a global movement, it works alongside people protesting in the developing world. Current campaigning is about stopping the UK financial sector from bankrolling climate change by ploughing billions into the dirty projects of fossil fuel companies.

The organising meeting of WDM is held on the first Thursday of each month, a time to discuss coming events and campaigns. It is usually followed by informal gathering in the nearby <i>Church House</i> pub, approx. 9.15-10.15pm (this replaces the previous arrangement of a pub meeting on the second Monday of the month at the Red Deer).

If you plan to come only to the pub then please contact so someone can meet you, (phone 07800 666553 or leave a message at the QMH), as occasionally the group does not go to the pub.
