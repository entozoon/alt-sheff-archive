		<td>Sharrow Lantern Carnival was set up in 2004 as a celebration of the first anniversary of the end of the Iraq war. The group who originally began the carnival wanted to bring peaceful protest to the streets of Sharrow. Today they keep to these morals by celebrating the creative community in Sharrow. The carnival takes place annually in April and there are free lantern making workshops running from January every Saturday. The theme for this year is Jungle Boogie!

Gathering Mount Pleasant Park, Sharrow Lane, nr London Rd. S11 8AE at 7.30pm
Set off 8pm to parade for an hour
Arrive at Sheffield General Cemetery (off Cemetery Road), 9pm till 10.30pm, for food, dancing, music, fire spinning and more! 

Volunteers and everyone welcome. See the website for lantern-making workshops details.
