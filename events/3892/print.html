The Festival of Debate is taking place in Sheffield in the run-up to the General election. It provides opportunities for groups, organisations and individuals to get together and discuss a range of issues which affect everyone. Informed decision making and strategic planning are essential for democracy, so come and get involved. They also welcome volunteers, from attending events and taking part in discussions to volunteering time to help run an event, promote the festival and much more. The events, during March and April, are listed here on Alt-Sheff. Unless otherwise stated events are free to attend, but if possible please register via the appropriate Eventbrite link on the Festival of Debate website below to give organsisers an idea of numbers.
