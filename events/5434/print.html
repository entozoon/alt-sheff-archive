		<td>The first in a 6-part series of open cinema, brought to you by Film Unit and Foodhall community-managed open public dining room. The Florida Project (2017) tells the story of a six year-old and her friends whose summer break is filled with childhood wonder, possibility and a sense of adventure while the adults around them struggle with hard times.

TV Dinners is cinema in the community. A monthly get-together for all. Future films will be chosen by vote. No barrier to entry, suggested donation of £5-£10. Film, popcorn, hot drinks and vegan dinner. Bring your own blanket!! Hot water bottles also welcome. Foodhall is cold during the winter, stay cosy with the shared sense of community and wellbeing.
