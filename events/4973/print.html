		<td>Theresa May´s announcement of a general election is a turning point for us all. After years of a Tory Government our public services are on their knees, our NHS is in crisis, our schools are underfunded, thousands rely on food banks to feed their families, people are on poverty wages while prices soar, the most vulnerable have been hit again and again. If the Tories get back into Government things will get much much worse. More cuts are planned, more privatisation, more misery for the majority. The People´s Assembly want to do all it can to ensure this does not happen. It´s not campaigning for any one political party - it is a cross-party campaign, but wants to make sure the main architects of austerity are out of office. The campaign won´t stop at the election, whatever the result. But a Tory-free Government is the first step towards ending austerity. The People´s Assembly will continue to highlight the crisis the Tories have created, and expose their real record in power. They are planning actions and events across the country which can expose the lies the Tory party will spread during the campaign. 

In the first part of the meeting, speaker Chris Owen from the #HandsOffHRI Campaign ((Huddersfield Royal Infirmary with its A & E faces closure, and a strong campaign against this closure has developed), plus a short discussion on the continuing campaign to defend our NHS.

In the business section officers for the organising committee will be elected. All positions will be available: Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, Communications Outreach, Campaigns. If you would like to stand for one or more of these positions, please email <a href="mailto:sheffieldpeoplesassembly@gmail.com">sheffieldpeoplesassembly@gmail.com</a> a short statement (50 words max) explaining why you think you are suitable. The deadline for receipt of nominations is Midnight on Monday 1st May. For more information on the roles, please email or call the Secretary Matthew Reeve on 07941 332993.
