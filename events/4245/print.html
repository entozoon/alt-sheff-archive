Floods, typhoons and droughts are already impacting many millions of people, both here and abroad. This humanitarian crisis affects those who have done least to create the problem the most, and left unchecked would affect us all. All over the world people are already putting into practice real solutions: public renewable energy, green infrastructure, millions of new, unionised clean jobs. But it needs to happen faster, at scale and with people at its centre.
