		<td>There are 650 MPs in the House of Commons. Only one of them is a scientist. Is it any wonder that politics so often lets science down, and fails to exploit its skeptical methods to design policies that are fit for purpose?

Mark Henderson, author of The Geek Manifesto, Head of Communications at The Wellcome Trust, speaking at a Skeptics in the Pub event. These are about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics. The events are free though they ask for a Â£2 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
