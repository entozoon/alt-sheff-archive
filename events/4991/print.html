		<td>Described as a ‘documentary-style feminist science fiction’, Lizzie Borden’s iconic film "Born in Flames" explores racism, classism and sexism with a US socialist democracy as its setting. Recently restored by Anthology Film Archives, this landmark picture is a key piece of female filmmaking. A Skype Q&A discussion with director Lizzie Borden will follow the screening.
