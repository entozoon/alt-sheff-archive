		<td>Sheffield Fayre returns for its twelfth year, with the Council signalling an end to the high degree of military recruitment involved. The focus is on the fantastic traditions of the fairground, in response to public demand and appreciation of the National Fairground Archive (based at University of Sheffield). This theme has been developing over the last few years thanks to the dedication of Professor Vanessa Toulmin. 

There will be a "Merrie England Village", street performers, dance and performance including morris dancing and maypoles, horticultural and craft tent, loads of stalls, food and drinks, and plenty of charity and community involvement.

Free entry. Organised by Sheffield City Council in partnership with the Friends of Norfolk Heritage Park and The University of Sheffield Fairground Archive.
