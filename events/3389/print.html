		<td>Join Open Rights Group Sheffield to hear from the MEP candidates for Yorkshire and the Humber and quiz them on their views on digital rights. In the run-up to the European elections (22nd May), Open Rights Group are holding MEP hustings across the country, to ask candidates to pledge to protect digital rights. The pledge will be tied into the <a href="https://www.wepromise.eu/en">"We Promise" 10 point charter</a>. MEPs help write laws on digital privacy, commerce, free speech online, copyright and net neutrality. Most of the big digital issues are affected by European rules so come and make sure your candidates hear what you have to say about digital rights. 

Candidates invited:
Andrew Cooper - Green (confirmed) 
Joe Otten - Liberal Democrat (confirmed) 
Conservative (to be confirmed) 
Labour (TBC) 
UKIP (TBC)
