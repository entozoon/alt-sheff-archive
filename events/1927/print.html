		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A public lecture by Prof. Wulf Daseking. Europe&#39;s &#39;greenest city’ is also one of its most economically successful, and a great place to live. How did it get there? Freiberg in South Germany is often cited as Europe’s &#39;greenest city’ for sustainability with extensive low-energy housing, large scale use of renewable fuels and very high use of public transport, walking and cycling built from a compact, short-distance city with a beautiful historic centre. It also enjoys a very strong economy based in part on solar power and an enviable quality of life which attracts talented people to study and work. How has this been achieved and what can business and local government in the Sheffield region learn from it?

Wulf Daseking has been the Head of Urban Planning for the City of Freiburg for over 20 years. Representatives of the Council, Civic Trust, Academy of Urbanism and Universities will be invited to respond, before a general discussion.

A free event with refreshments after, presented by Sheffield Urban Think-Tank, sponsored by Sheffield City Council, Sheffield City Region Local Enterprise Partnership, Universities of Sheffield and Hallam, Sheffield Civic Trust, RIBA Yorks, S. Yorkshire Forest & Integreat +</td>
