		<th>Details</th>
		<td>All women are welcome to join this vigil which is protesting against the current immigration rules which do not allow women who have come to this country under a Spouse Visa but who then experience domestic violence to have recourse to public funds-benefits and public housing. This means they may feel they have no option but to remain in an abusive relationship, with all that that may mean for themselves and any children they may have, or else they may be at the mercy of friends and family or on the street.

There will be a letter for people to send to their MP asking her or him to lobby the government to abolish the so-called 'no recourse' rule and info will be available about the Sheffield Women's No Recourse Fund.
