		<td>The travel pass campaign is stepping up its efforts to get the authorities to reinstate free train travel. Charges have been dropped against the two South Yorkshire freedom riders who were arrested at Sheffield railway station in June this year. 
The freedom riders have decided to carry on with the planned rally, but to turn it into a celebration of the decision to drop charges. Free transport is being laid on from Barnsley, Huddersfield, Rotherham and Doncaster.

The freedom riders have carried out a long-running campaign for the reversal of cuts in travel passes for older people and disabled people. They organised mass protests where they travelled without tickets between the South Yorkshire towns. 
They won round one in June, getting back free travel for disabled people and half-price on the train for older people. Now they have won round two. Round three is coming up...

 They will also lobby the next meeting of the South Yorkshire Transport Committee, from 1pm on Monday, 15th December, at Regent Street, Barnsley.
