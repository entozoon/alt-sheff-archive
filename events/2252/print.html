		<td>G4S is a multinational private security army. Even before they messed up the Olympics security, they were awarded a Â£135m government contract to house asylum seekers in Yorkshire, despite having a deadly record of abuse and racism, and no experience as a housing agency. 

Activists from various anti-G4S campaigns are coming together for a UK-wide gathering in Sheffield. Individuals and campaign groups are invited to attend to share, network, strategise and plan how to build an even more effective Stop G4S campaign. The gathering is open to all who oppose G4S and want to work with others to Stop G4S from taking over public services for private profit while violating human rights.

The gathering will launch the UK "StopG4S" campaign coalition, bringing together grassroots campaigns, networks and organisations with the aim of providing support, resources, guidance and skill-sharing. This coalition will be inclusive and non-hierarchical.
