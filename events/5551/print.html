		<td>Current social and political issues affect us at every level including in our everyday lives. They  are mirrored in our workplaces, in our relationships and even in ourselves. More than ever we need spaces for deeper dialogue, opportunities to hear and try to understand one another. 

Politicians often present issues in a simple, polarised way, ignoring complexity.  Swamped by this kind of news on many important issues, we may find ourselves for or against something, leaving a ‘like’ or ‘dislike’ tag, without deeper reflection - thus reducing ourselves to binary reactions. If this happens constantly, it generates apathy and hopelessness about the future. If you are interested in what creates cohesion or division in Sheffield, join us. You will have the opportunity to engage with others in facilitated dialogue as we explore the topic.
