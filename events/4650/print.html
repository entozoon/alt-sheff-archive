		<th>Details</th>
		<td>AFC Unity are a Sheffield based indie women&#39;s football club and also a not-for-profit community organisation. Their current Football for Food campaign collects food at home games and events to distribute via Sheffield Food Collective to local food banks. 

As part of this, they are holding this Football for Food tournament. Rather than paying to enter a team into the competition, teams will enter through donations of food and they will encourage spectators to donate food as well. All food collected will be distributed to local food banks via Sheffield Food Collective. Alongside this, they are hosting a series of talks on the issues related to food banks, food poverty and community responses - these talks will take place inside the U-Mix Centre as the tournament is taking place outside.
