		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The imprisonment of WikiLeaks founder and journalist Julian Assange is a political crime that threatens the democratic rights of the entire working class. Wikileaks has exposed the murder by the US military of <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Collateral_Murder,_5_Apr_2010">unarmed civilians in Iraq</a> and Afghanistan, among many other atrocities.

Chelsea Manning is a former US soldier who leaked materials to Wikileaks. She is now imprisoned again for refusing on principle to testify to a secret grand jury convened against Assange and Wikileaks.

This meeting of the Socialist Equality Party will cover their demands for withdrawal of all charges, a guarantee against Assangeâ€™s US extradition and his safe passage to Australia, and that the Trump administration frees Chelsea Manning immediately and unconditionally.
