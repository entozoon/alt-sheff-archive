		<td>At that lovely time of year when the fruit is ripe for pickin' n the pixies are plannin' a scrumpin' expedition to the Earth Centre (Conisbrough - next to the rail station) and would like some help to harvest the abundant bounty of apples and distribute the hoard to the local people (and make another earth pie for the council who continue to deny communities access to the 400 acre site full of food, wildlife and medicine).

It's been six years since its closure and Doncaster council and their mates remain tightlipped on any goings on, if you're still unsure about its dodgy past and future check out the blog below and look into the 'not for profit' company RTTG that is working with DMBC to take it over. Also if you're unaware of the following please have a look at the advanced manufacturing park in Catcliffe, Rotherham, where other technomanic war criminal companies are working together to produce parts for unmanned land and air vehicles (drones) and nuclear research. It's uncanny that all this technology (ie RTTG) is coming to South Yorkshire at the same time, and it's us and our families that will be affected.
