		<td>If you would like to help out a bit with cycling campaigns but can’t afford to give up lots of time to help then please come to this and find out how much or how little you could do to help the campaigns. The aim is to help you learn about the Road Justice and Space4Cycling Campaigns and what skills and tactics work well for campaigners. Everybody is welcome. It is free and all refreshments and lunch are provided. You don’t have to be a CTC, or a CycleSheffield, just have an interest in cycling!
