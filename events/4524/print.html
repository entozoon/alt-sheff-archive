		<td>Sheffield Palestine Education Network invites you to a special meeting where Kirsty Wright will speak about the impact of occupation on education. Kirsty has supported humanitarian and recovery programmes with the liberation movements in Eritrea and Ethiopia and with refugees in the Sudan. She has lived and worked in Palestine for 26 years, currently working as a development researcher with a local Palestinian company. She has witnessed the profound social and political changes resulting from the Oslo process and their impacts on all aspects of the daily lives of Palestinians. Kirsty recently completed research on Israeli attacks on the Palestinian education system in general, and on schools and universities in particular, and will report and discuss her research findings.

There will also be a report from Sara Gowen of Sheffield Palestine WomenÂ´s Scholarship Fund, on its work in supporting women students at universities in Gaza.

 For further information about the meeting and the activities of Sheffield Palestine Education Network, please email <a href="mailto:P.E.Jones@shu.ac.uk">Peter Jones</a></td>
