Julie Bindel will be talking in Sheffield about the No Platforming of Radical Feminists. The talk will be followed by more than an hour of questions and discussion with Julie. An event organised by RadFem Collective, in partnership with the gender-critical transgender Miranda Yardley. (Note this is not a panel discussion and Miranda will not be speaking.) This is a mixed event and everyone is welcome, whatever your views, an inclusive and productive event with respectful dialogue not resorting to name-calling or personal attacks. Please respect this.

The venue is fully wheelchair accessible. If you have any other accessibility needs, please contact the organisers who will do their very best to meet them. The ticket price is purely to cover costs such as room and PA hire. All involved are volunteers. Tickets available from: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-no-platforming-of-radical-feminists-tickets-14943980849">Eventbrite booking</a>
