		<td>Sheffield Environment Weeks was set up by voluntary and community groups to support and promote their activities so please send a representative from your group to the AGM and support Environment Weeks. 

Over the years, Sheffield Environment Weeks has been the driving force behind loads of good work around the city. They would appreciate hearing your views about Environment Weeks and whether they should continue. If so, they need at least two more members for the working group which meets about six times a year.
