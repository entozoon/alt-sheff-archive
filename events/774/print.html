		<td>The measures outlined in the emergency budget on June 22 represent a concerted campaign by the coalition government to dismantle what remains of the welfare state. The full implications of these cuts are being hidden and devolved to local authorities. Whilst the poorest sections of society will be the hardest hit and the livelihoods of millions are at risk, big business and the banks continue to rake in their profits.

This Socialist Equality Party/World Socialist Web Site discussion forum will outline the implications of the budget for working people and outline a socialist response for workers to defend their independent interests.
