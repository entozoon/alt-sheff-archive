		<td>BitFIXit is a group of volunteers and professionals which has been fixing computers since 2005 on a not-for-profit basis. They pop up every Friday at <a href="http://www.union-st.org/">Union Street</a> co-operative co-working space. Anyone can drop in for a free diagnosis or chat about computer problems. They fix things for Â£20 per hour (on the spot or collect later). Sessions also on Saturdays in Burngreave.
