	<tr>
		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Join Daniele and James ("the polite pruners") on a foraging walk looking at what food and medicine plants are around at this time of year, and learn some recipes and uses for them.

Followed by a picnic in the park after the walk finishes (1.30pm) so please bring some food to share - this does not have to be foraged ingredients! :-)

Fee for walk is on a pay-as-you-feel basis, suggested amount is Â£5-10 but don&#39;t let finance be a barrier, any amount or none is okay. Meet in the park opposite the Brother&#39;s Arms pub on Gleadless Road, S8 9TZ.</td>
