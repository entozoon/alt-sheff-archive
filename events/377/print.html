		<td>Since the start of this Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) project, decisions at all meetings have been made using consensus based decision making, though this isn't something everybody is experienced in using, so an event has been organised, open to all potential members of the co-op. 

This workshop is only going ahead if there is enough interest in it, so if you are a potential member of the Hazelhurst CSA Co-op (it'll be open to all to join) and you are free, please indicate that you can come (and answer the questions) at:
