		<td>Sheffield Equality Group meetings aim to be an open space where people can discuss and plan actions around income equality. Meetings are on the first Wednesday in every month. This month will be continuing discussion on a survey about basic income. The aim is to carry out the survey, interviewing people and getting evidence about views on a basic income, and whether, and how, to encourage a change of opinion about social support. This is a tentative exploration and hopefully the starting point for a wider discussion in Sheffield and beyond. If you are interested, any help with this would be great.
