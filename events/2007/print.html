		<td>Meeting of the Sheffield Humanist Society with Liz Coates and Paul Stewart, of the World Development Movement (<a href="http://www.wdm.org.uk/">www.wdm.org.uk</a>). Using examples and short videos they will show something of its activities both local and national, and some of its successes since it began over 40 years ago. Those attending will be asked to help in evaluation of part of two of its campaigns. Particular emphasis will be given to the recent campaign "Stop Betting on Hunger" - concerning speculation on food prices.

<i>"Speculation in basic foodstuffs is a scandal when there are a billion starving people in the world. We must ensure markets contribute to sustainable growth. I am fighting for a fairer world and I want Europe to take the lead on that." </i>Michel Barnier, European commissioner for the internal market.

The University Arms is close to the tram, get off at the Sheffield University stop, and several buses pass nearby including the 51 & 52, stopping almost next to the pub, with the 95 & 123 a short walk away. Parking is available in the streets behind the pub. <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=university+arms+sheffield">Google map of the location click here</a>
