		<td>Are you against the High Speed Rail 2 which could come through Sheffield? Do you want to see it stopped? Do you want to learn more about the project and how to campaign against it? Then come to the second Stop HS2 National Convention.

Thirty sessions on all aspects of the project and what you can do.  You will have the chance to meet with people up and down the line, including those who have been living under the shadow of HS2 for the last three years.

Held at the Staffordshire County Showground it will be a crash course on all aspects of the HS2 project and campaigning against it.

Contributors include Deputy Leader of the Green Party, Will Duckworth, all of the main groups opposing HS2: Stop HS2, HS2 Action Alliance, AGHAST and 51m and both the Woodland Trust and the Wildlife Trusts explaining the environmental devastation which HS2 would bring. Economics professors will explain the holes in the business and economics case.
