		<td>Rotherham Show is apparently the largest free land show in the North of England. Well worth a visit, it goes on all weekend in Clifton Park close to the town centre. Entertainment, horticultural show, fresh produce and craft quarter for original gifts and quality local and regional artisan foods, vintage vehicles, fun fair, stalls and refreshments, and music to suit all tastes. 

The main arena is hosted by local radio station Rother FM. Additional events include the Diversity Festival, a fantastic display of Rotherhamâ€™s beautiful communities which showcases and celebrates different cultures, faiths and beliefs in and around Rotherham. Performances this year range from performance poetry to jive, Bollywood dance to French folk.
