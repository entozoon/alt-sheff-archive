		<td>One-fifth (19%) of the population of the City of Sheffield are disabled people. Join Disability Sheffield, the Disability Hub, and Healthwatch to debate the future of the care "industry" as a catastrophe in the making and how we can stop that happening. Too many lives are at risk to keep meandering towards tragedy.

A free event as part of this yearâ€™s <a href="https://www.festivalofdebate.com/">Festival of Debate</a> in association with Disability Sheffield.
