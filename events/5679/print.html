		<td>A chance to meet, chat, and learn with Labour Party members and supporters. Building a ’society for the many’ doesn’t have to just mean going to meetings and door knocking, but also time to relax and get to know each other. Join in any time from 11-2pm for a chilled drop-in and learning session. 

This session will include ‘Labour 101’ training from 12-1pm, explaining and discussing the different structures of the Labour Party in Sheffield. How can you get involved? What do these structures do? How to create a Labour Party which works for and is accessible to everybody?
