		<td>The latest Transition Sheffield event, all welcome. The theme of the Cafe will be Skilling Up for Power Down, with an hour of sharing ideas and information around the theme of re-skilling for life beyond oil. As our economy changes and oil and food prices rise, we'll need new skills to help ourselves and our local communities move beyond our addiction to cheap oil. From food-growing and bike-riding to community leadership, energy generation and new ways of working and doing business, we will discuss how we can re-skill ourselves and Sheffield for future resilience.

The evening will begin at 7pm, with discussion and sharing of ideas and information from 7.30-9pm, followed by an hour of drinks and chat. Snacks, beer, and hot and cold drinks available.
