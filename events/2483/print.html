		<td>Making another world real. A day event abour resistances, participation and social change in Latin America now. As the "west" experiences austerity, the destruction of the welfare state, the naked brutality of the free market, the suffering of many to secure immense profits for the few, and the blind consumption of the planet&#39;s resources and future, Latin America is showing us an alternative – a just and fair society run by the people for the people. Sessions on resistance and alternatives to neoliberalism in various Latin American countries, with speakers including Emily Morris – Institute of the Americas, University College London; Colin Burgon – Venezuela Solidarity Campaign; Alex Tilley – Bolivia Information Forum and Patrick Kane – War on Want. Latin America Now! is being organised by the many Latin America support groups in Manchester. (Note Sheffield also has groups for solidarity links with Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, see Alt-Sheff links page, and click "International")
