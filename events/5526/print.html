		<th>Details</th>
		<td>This 1984 film is a haunting and terrifying look at the impact of nuclear war on a city, which gave a boost to the anti-nuclear movement. It was filmed in Sheffield, including the Nottingham House pub. As panic increases, Sheffielders stock up on supplies and attempt to flee to the safety of the countryside. When a nuclear bomb explodes above the city, thousands are killed instantly - the lucky ones. The Film Unit describes it as an "unforgettable experience and scarier than any horror film." 

The Film Unit is mainly volunteer-run, and <strong>is not just for students</strong>. It is based in the Nelson Mandela Auditorium, at Western Bank (off Glossop Road).
