		<td>Researcher and writer Richard MacLean Smith talks about his book "Unexplained". Based on his podcast series <a href="https://www.unexplainedpodcast.com/">Unexplained</a>, it covers strange unsolved mysteries from around the world, analysed with open minded scepticism. Subjects range from political conspiracy theories to historical cases, and whether things traditionally thought to be supernatural may in fact lead to new scientific discoveries.
