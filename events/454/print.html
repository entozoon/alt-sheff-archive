		<td>The BNP intends to stand 16 candidates in this year's local elections in Sheffield. They are also putting up one of their national leaders, Mark Collett, in the Brightside & Hillsborough constituency. He has been exposed by the Sheffield Star as a "Hitler admirer" (<a href="http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/Hitler-admirer39s-bid-to-be.6021680.jp">Click here for article</a>). It is vital that we encourage all those who oppose the BNP's fascism and racist poison to use their vote.  If the BNP is decisively defeated this year, it will make it impossible for them to use the 2010 elections to boost their prospects in next year's local elections. 

New local groups have been set up to challenge the BNP across the city. Please come to the meetings to organise local activities.<ul><li>Heeley constituency group on Tuesday, 9th March at 7.30pm, St Thomas of Canterbury Church Hall, 34 Meadowhead</li><li>Burngreave group on Monday, 15th March at 7.30, the Yemeni Community Association, 2nd Floor, Firvale Centre, Earl Marshal Road, S4 8LA</li><li>Firth Park group on Tuesday, 16th March at 7.30pm, the Methodist Church, Stubbin Lane, Firth Park, S5 6QN</li><li>Sharrow group on Thursday 25th March at 7.30pm in St Peters Hall, Woodstock Road</li></ul>
