		<td>The first exhibition of Bank Street Arts’ Occupation: Free Art Space For Free Education season is Natasha Spires’ project ‘Contamination’. The work consists of a projected video piece of Spires’ previous intervention, and an evolving installation constructed over the period of her exhibition.

A Private View for this exhibition will be held on Thursday 20th January 2011, 6pm-8pm.
“Plastic bags drive our economy from mass production, convenience and disposability. But it is these bags that contaminate the environment, cause instability, harm and irritation to nature. A visual pollution, an act of vandalism or carelessness, plastic bags are not only driving our economy but ruining it at the same time.”

This exhibition forms part of Bank Street Arts celebration of Student Artists, Occupation: Free Art Space for Free Education.

To highlight the importance of their influence on our city, Bank Street Arts is offering free access to our Project Spaces for students to create, exhibit or otherwise occupy. We invite proposals for the creative use of the spaces from anyone currently studying, in any field, in any institution, at any level. 

Bank Street Arts is accepting submissions until January 15th 2011.</td>
