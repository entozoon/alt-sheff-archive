		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a monthly evening bike ride, everyone welcome. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. This month, "The Sheffield Pals" commemorates the 12th Service Battalion of the Yorks and Lancaster Regiment, volunteers enrolled in September 1914 and tragically wiped out in the senseless slaughter of World War One. The ride goes up to Redmires where they went to live and train; more details on Sheffield FNR website.
