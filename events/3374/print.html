Technology dominates our world, but many people think ‘its just a neutral tool’ or that technology = progress.  Although it does bring some benefits, most technology designed and controlled by corporate, military and technocratic elites to serve their interests and exert their power. If you’re part of a campaigning group focusing on a single issue and you’re not sure how this event will help the work of your group, please consider these points: single issue campaigning can only be really effective if it’s based on a broad understanding of the forces creating the problem. In addition to being shaped by military and corporate interests, technology has its own ideology and dynamic that is a major source of the problems caused by technologies. If we ignore this, we are constantly left reacting to problems created by technology, rather than proactively addressing the source of the problem. The gathering is about breaking the frames that keep each campaign separate and making the links between our different issues.

The gathering won’t just be talking and thinking – there will be hands on workshops, music, poetry and time to explore the beautiful grounds of Unstone Grange and the surrounding Derbyshire countryside. Speakers from campaigning groups and lots of time for discussion.  

There will be childcare available during the daytime so parents can fully participate in the gathering. Don’t delay, places are going fast! Participation and input needed to help take a leap forward in radical politics.
