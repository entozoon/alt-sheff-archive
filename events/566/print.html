		<td>Film showing upstairs at the Rutland about hunters' violence against people and animals. 

"When Slad Valley resident Nisa Ward witnessed a deer torn apart by out-of-control hunting hounds her life changed forever. As a child lost in the woods of a grim fairy tale she unearths a shocking world of cruelty, violence and fear. This film follows her journey of discovery as she tries to understand why the right to hunt and kill animals for sport is so important to a small, but very powerful, group of English people." 
 
£2 suggested donation for hunt sabs, film starting at 8pm. Also food including cakes will be available to raise money for Sheffield Animal Friends, as part of <a href="http://www.veganbakesale.org/">World Wide Vegan Bake Sale week</a>.
