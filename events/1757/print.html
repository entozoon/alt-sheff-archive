		<td>The World Development Movement (WDM) is a UK-based anti-poverty campaigning organisation. Their welcoming pub meetings are held on the 2nd Monday of every month. This is an relaxed, informal environment and is ideal for newcomers to make contact. A mixture of conversation to understand the issues, sleeves-rolled-up sorting out of practical campaigning details, and lots of fun coming up with new ideas for eye-catching stunts!
