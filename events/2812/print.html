		<td>Exhibition of Chilean Arpilleras and patchworks.

This is a unique opportunity to see arpilleras made by relatives of prisoners and disappeared people under Pinochet’s regime. These will be exhibited together with patchworks designed and made by the members of the Chilean Community’s Andes Group who responded to their exile by interweaving memories from back home and the life they now lived. 

This exhibition is part of the <b>Chile40YearsOn network</b> commemoration of the 40th Aniversary of the social-human tragedy brought about by Pinochet’s right-wing military coup in Chile.

Arpilleras are the art of a collective national memory. During the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship, many Chilean women created complex tapestries, constructed from scraps of cloth, depicting the harsh conditions of life and the pain resulting from the imprisonment of relatives and the disappeared victims of Pinochet’s repression. 

In their refusal to forget, the arpilleristas created the unwritten history of a country silenced by terror and brutality. They are a visible reminder of one of the darkest periods in Chilean history.
