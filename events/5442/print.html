Across the world, city innovators are putting real sustainability into practice - from transforming abandoned public spaces and setting up community co-operatives, to rewilding urban nature and powering up civic energy. Lecturer, writer and activist Paul Chatterton explores the power of these city experiments that harness the creative power of the collective, focusing on five themes: compassion, imagination, experimentation, co-production and transformation; and four city systems: mobility, energy, community and nature. Imagining radical alternatives, such as car-free, post-carbon, common and ´bio-cities´, this is a toolkit for unlocking real urban change.

Tickets £4 or £6.
