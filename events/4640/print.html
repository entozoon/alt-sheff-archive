		<td>The Convoy to Calais is a huge national demonstration of solidarity with refugees, supported by unions, pressure groups and social movements. They need people to come on the convoy from Sheffield and to donate money to buy goods required by the refugees in the Calais camp. This is practical aid and a huge moving protest at the way governments across the continent are failing refugees. 

Organised by Stand up to Racism, Peopleâ€™s Assembly Against Austerity, Unite the Union, Communications Workers Union, TSSA, Stop the War Coalition, War on Want, Momentum & Muslim Association of Britain.

To donate (see the list of items needed) or to go on the convoy by lorry, van, bus, car, motorbike or scooter see the links below for full details.

The huge aid convoy, planned for months, is now facing a last minute ban by the French border controls at the ferry port in Dover. Campaigners are calling for David Cameron to intervene against this undemocratic and authoritarian decision: sign the  <a href="https://www.change.org/p/embassy-of-france-in-the-uk-ambassade-de-france-au-ru-convoy-to-calais-let-us-pass?recruiter=261430471&amp;utm_campaign=signature_receipt&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=share_petition">petition on Change.org here</a>
