	<p class="message">It&#39;s January.  It&#39;s freezing, and now the bills are starting to bite. As the Big Six energy companies rake in profits of 700% and the government freezes the fuel allowance, it&#39;s time to tell the Big Six and the government that we&#39;ve had enough!  Small reductions in bills by some companies are a drop in the ocean: many people are still going cold or cutting down on food. The Bix Six continues to blame extortionate fuel prices on the switch to green energy. In fact, green measures only account for a tiny percentage of the price hike. The real story is of an energy monopoly making massive profits from spiraling prices, and continuing to burn fossil fuels at a climate-wrecking rate. The cost of their profits is people dying cold in their homes in the UK, and suffering the devastating effects of climate change across the world. One in four families in the UK is shivering, out of sight, behind closed doors. Meanwhile six companies are deciding how 99% of our energy is sourced, produced and priced. We think it&#39;s time we had a say in these decisions, which have a major effect on our health and our climate.The &#39;Warm Ups&#39;: On the last weekend of January, Fuel Poverty Action will be heating things up! People across the UK will come out of their cold homes and into the warm offices of the Big Six: E.ON, EDF, Scottish Power, Scottish and Southern, Centrica (British Gas), and Npower. Others will warm-up at town halls and housing associations, which are putting profit and cuts before people&#39;s welfare.Bearing flasks of tea and our own experiences of landlords that won&#39;t listen, unaffordable bills, tuition fees, and debts, as well as cuts in services, benefits and working conditions, our winter warm-ups will be taking place wherever cuts are biting and warm spaces look inviting. As people warm up, they&#39;ll be taking the chance to discuss how to achieve a democratic, sustainable energy system. This is a call to anti-cuts groups, local youth and pensioner organisations, environmental groups, and anyone who knows that it&#39;s time to break the stranglehold of the Big Six. Stop shivering in silence, let&#39;s warm-up together!Organise your own winter warm up!
