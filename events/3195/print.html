		<td>For the 3rd year in a row, February seed swapping at Heeley City Farm. Everyone is welcome. You can bring home-saved seeds to swap if you have them but don’t worry if you don’t – there will be plenty of seeds available for donation, including a massive assortment of weird and wonderful seeds from the seed bank of the late Richard Clare.

Entrance is free but donations for seeds are welcome. The farm cafe will be open serving hot drinks, food and cake. Contact for more information Daniele on 07535 653842
