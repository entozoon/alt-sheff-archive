		<td>In January Bavwidi Mpanzu (or 'Djoly' as his friends know him) was arrested under the cruel law which makes working illegal for asylum seekers, after desperately waiting years for a decision. He was sent to Doncaster prison where he remains, waiting for sentencing today, May 12th. Djoly and the campaign are asking for the biggest possible turn out at court to show the support that he has in Sheffield.

The campaign to defend Djoly, a well-known community activist from the Democratic Republic of Congo meets at Scotia Works, Leadmill Road, Sheffield S1 4SE. Contact Africa Time for more information: Dama Safari: 07904222467 or Pascal Bongongo: 07908321788 or James Kazadi: 07961761899</td>
