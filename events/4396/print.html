		<td>"Bicycling has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance" said Susan B. Anthony, US Suffragist, in 1896.

Sheffield Friday Night Ride invites all to celebrate <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SheFestSheffield/">SheFest 2016</a> and <a href="http://www.internationalwomensday.com/">International Women’s Day</a> (Wednesday 8th March 2016) with a cycle ride to locations in Sheffield associated with the campaigns for women’s emancipation. The main focus is sites to do with the struggle for Votes for Women but it also may go past other relevant sites like the first women’s clinics in Sheffield.

You can ride a 4 mile or a 7 mile route. 6.30pm start at the gates to City Museum, Western Bank for 7 miles, or 7.15pm ride pick up at Cathedral Forecourt, Church Street for the 4 mile route. Everything you need to know for this ride is at the link below.
