		<td>In April, Steve Kinneavy is joining a team of volunteers from <a href="http://www.amostrust.org/">Amos Trust</a> travelling to Palestine to live and work alongside local people to help rebuild their community. Steve will help a family return to their home and community by helping to rebuild their house.

He is taking part in this project to highlight the injustice of Palestinian homes being demolished by the Israeli authorities, and as an act of support and solidarity for Palestinians working non-violently for a just peace. Come and start the weekend early and support a fantastic cause!
