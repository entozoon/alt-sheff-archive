		<td>Some problems in this world are just too big to solve. However, homelessness in Sheffield is something that we can absolutely solve. Festival of Debate in association with Roundabout are bringing together all the people in Sheffield who know homelessness to work out how to make sure nobody has to sleep out in our city ever again. Be part of it!

Tickets free. Festival of Debate is hosted by not-for-profit social enterprise <a href="http://www.opusindependents.com/">Opus Independents</a> (which also publishes a monthly Alt-Sheff column in <a href="http://nowthenmagazine.com/sheffield/">Now Then magazine</a>).
