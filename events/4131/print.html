		<td>SFNR offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. Their motto is: “We have nothing to lose but our chains! (But bring locks and lights too, just in case)”. 

This is a ride to Sheffield sites loosely associated with magic, and at each stop the nightrider prestdigitateur, Simon, will entertain with some conjuring.
