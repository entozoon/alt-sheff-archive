		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Rotherham Show is called the largest free land show in the North of England. Well worth a visit, it goes on all weekend in the beautiful green surroundings of Clifton Park, close to the town centre. Entertainment, Diversity Festival, Horticultural Show, animal shows, fresh produce and crafts, gift and food stalls, vintage vehicles, fun fair, stalls and refreshments, and music to suit all tastes. This year new attractions include an AdVintageous Pop-Up Vintage Fair, magical walkabouts and an enormous whale! 

Sadly the military displays are still there, in the continued attempt to recruit children by interesting them in militaria fetishism at a young age. <a href="https://www.child-soldiers.org/News/press-release-support-us-to-raise-the-uk-military-recruitment-age-from-16-to-18-years">(The UK is still recruiting from age 16,</a> the only EU and UN Security Council country to do so. Meanwhile experienced adult soldiers are made redundant due to budget cuts.)
