		<td>Peace in the Park is Sheffield’s community arts festival – organised by volunteers, funded entirely by the people of Sheffield and supported by artists, musicians, students, event organisers and other everyday folk from the city working as a not for profit collective. It has become a movement celebrating Sheffield’s freedom and creativity – showcasing arts, music and performance, raising thousands for good causes and promoting peace, understanding and social justice.

This is their September pop-up event and the location will be revealed nearer the time.
