		<td>An invitation-only preview evening, where preliminary plans will be on show by representatives from Sainsburys and Fletchers who intend to submit a planning application for the development of land at Fletchers bakery site off Claywheels Lane.

The plans will go on show to the general public at the Niagara Club on Friday 16 July from 12pm until 7pm and Saturday 17 July from 10am till 2pm. 

Wadsley bridge can look forward to a new 50,000 sq ft Sainsburys megastore, restaurant and recycling area (aww, bless 'em), with 400 full and part-time jobs. 425 car parking spaces including more congestion for this busy area so it needs a new road junction to Claywheels Lane from Penistone Road.
