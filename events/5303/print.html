		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A film about nuclear war, filmed in Sheffield, showing the possible horror of the impact. It was made during "Cold War" and it is not easy to watch, especially as it seems just as relevant in our world today. Please note this film is suitable for people aged 15 and over, and contains extremely distressing scenes of war and violence.

Price £6 / £4.50 concession (plus booking fee).
