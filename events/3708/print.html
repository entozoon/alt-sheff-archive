		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Join ASSIST for an evening of music and drink at the cafe-style gig with bar, complete with great soulful vibes, courtesy of The Reluctants and Arash! The Reluctants are a seven-piece Up-beat Rock & Soul band, and Arash Shafiei Sabet is a singer song-writer from Iran.

As well as enjoying some Autumn revelry, you will be helping raise money for ASSIST Sheffield, allowing them to continue to support destitute and vulnerable asylum seekers. Double win!

Sadly the originally-billed Yorkshire Teabags have had to cancel owing to illness. ASSIST gives a big thank you to Arash for stepping in.

Tickets are £5 or £6 on the door. Doors open at 7:30pm. You can get tickets by emailing <a href="mailto:efa@assistsheffield.org.uk">efa@assistsheffield.org.uk</a>, or calling Robert on 07903 092 558.
