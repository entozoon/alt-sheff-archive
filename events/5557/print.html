		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. Their motto is: "We have nothing to lose but our chains!" (But bring locks and lights too, just in case!) This is the second ride to places based on the theme of Sheffield Modern organised by Mick Nott. 

Full details of each ride are put on the website before the rides.
