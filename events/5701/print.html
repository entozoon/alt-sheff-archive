		<td>Mobile network providers like EE claim that 5G (fifth generation) technology is necessary for faster download/upload speeds. The government accepts this, and it has started to be rolled out across some UK cities. But 5G technology is controversial, including concerns about potential health risks and surveillance/security risks.

Ian R Crane is a former oilfield services executive who has spent the past seven years supporting communities resisting the UK Government fracking agenda. In late 2017, Ian became aware that country-wide tree-culling was directly related to the planned roll-out of 5G, because organic material (like tree trunks and leaves) interferes with 5G transmission frequencies. This prompted him to study the available academic research. 5G uses radio-wave frequencies in the areas that "microwave" things. This was discovered in the early days of radar, but the US Senate was recently told that there is <a href="https://takebackyourpower.net/senate-hearing-wireless-industry-confesses-no-studies-showing-5g-safety/">no real research on impacts under the proposed 5G system</a>. 

This thought-provoking presentation will question the technology and our reliance on it. Ian encourages people to do their own research. The event is part of <a href="https://alternativeview.co.uk/index.php#clip=ciivh8o0qr4s">five-week tour of venues</a> around UK. Tickets £8 in advance (£10 on the door).
