		<td>FridayNightRide (FNR) is a long-running, all-welcome bike ride, on a theme. This time it's Libraries and Bookshops, visiting and supporting them before the cuts from the present set of cultural barbarians in government cuts the funds entirely. Meet at Tudor Square, beside the City Library and Crucible Theatre (next to the site of the former Independent Bookshop). Bring your library card, they may have a mass take-out, and some money, a bookshop may stay open for the riders.

By the way FNR is featured in issue 5 of sumptuous cycling magazine <a href="http://www.theridejournal.com/">The Ride</a>, which has cool stuff about all kinds of riding. (Copies available for Â£7 cash at ReCycleBikes, top of Thirlwell Rd, S8 9TF, Sheff 2507717)

Full ride details available soon on website <a href="http://www.sheffieldfridaynightride.org.uk/">www.sheffieldfridaynightride.org.uk</a></td>
