		<td>A gig to celebrate twenty years since the release of Live Through This by Hole, one of the most well-known bands associated with the early 1990s riot grrrl scene. Organised by LaDIYFest Sheffield, a DIY, anti-capitalist, community based, feminist festival run by volunteers, led primarily by women but all are welcome to get involved. It aims to highlight female and LGBTQ art, projects and activism in the community, promoting social change in a non-discriminatory environment through music, performance art, spoken word, films, discussions, exhibitions and workshops.

- Covers of songs from the album and by Hole’s contemporaries
- DJs and dancing 
- Birthday sweets and party food (including love hearts)
- FANCY DRESS. Bring your best babydoll dresses, tiaras, torn fishnets and smudged mascara
- A prize for the best Courtney Love

Suggested donation £4 to cover bands’ costs and fund this year’s festival, but as usual it’s pay what you can. Bring your own drinks.
