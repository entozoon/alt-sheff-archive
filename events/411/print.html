		<td>This is an eye-witness report from a recent visit to Cuba's medical brigade in Haiti, by Phil Lenton, coordinator for trade union sponsored NGO  'Salud International'.

Cuban doctors in Haiti swung into action after the earthquake, reopening 3 hospitals in Port-au-Prince and attending to people without the ridiculous use of US-style military control.

All donations received at the meeting will help sustain the Cuban medical brigade in Haiti. Meeting costs will be met by <a href="http://www.cuba-solidarity.org.uk/">Sheffield Cuba Solidarity Campaign</a></td>
