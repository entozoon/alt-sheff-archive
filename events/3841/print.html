Being an Aid Worker – Basic Skills course will take you through a fictional scenario based on real-life events, drawn from a combined 20 years of field experience. The course will introduce you to some of the essential skills needed when working in the field, including:

•	Personal skills such as stress, security and time management
•	Programmatic skills such as getting to grips with your project, conducting field assessments, managing budgets and monitoring

Aid Works is a social enterprise based in Sheffield, run by Mia Ali and Mo, who is currently training with the School for Social Entrepreneurs (SSE Yorkshire and Humber), which provides action learning programmes to support social entrepreneurs to grow social and community organisations. Aid Works helps NGOs to strengthen their systems, and supports local and international aid workers to reach their potential through training and e-learning. It is funded by School for Social Entrepreneurs, Lloyds Bank Social Entrepreneurs Programme and The Big Lottery Fund. It is a member of the newly formed South Yorkshire International Development Network (SYIDN), a coordination mechanism for local aid organisations. The Get the North to the South project helps talented people from the North of England to get into aid work, overcoming barriers which people from outside London face when trying to get into aid work.

Course cost: £70. Students: further £20 discount. See <a href="http://www.aidworks.org.uk/">www.aidworks.org.uk</a> for full details and to book.</td>
