		<td>Everyone is welcome to attend Sheffield Vegan Potluck, held on the first Monday of every month. Come and meet other like-minded people in a relaxed social atmosphere. Share your favourite vegan food. It’s a great way to try vegan food if you’re thinking about going vegan.

Guidelines: Bring a homemade vegan dish to share. Please ensure that the food you bring is 100% VEGAN. Please bring dishes that are ready to eat and don’t need heating up. Please bring serving / cutting implements for your dish. Please only bring homemade food – NO shop bought items and NO drinks as you can buy these at the bar. Please write out the ingredients for your dish to display beside it so people with allergies can avoid certain food. Plates and cutlery will be provided.</td>
