		<td>The Peace in the Park festival promotes peace and understanding by bringing together communities through artistic, musical and vocal expression. Peace in the Park is organised by a voluntary group of artists, musicians, students, events organisers and other everyday Sheffield folk, working together in a not for profit collective. Music, food, loads of stalls and fun in the sun. 

This year Sheffield's major free festival is donating surplus funds to support Self-Help Africa and Sheffield Mind.
