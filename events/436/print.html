		<td>Our bus service is an inadequate rip-off. If you're not annoyed, you're not a bus user, most likely. The elections loom and First Bus turns up the pressure with service cuts and price hikes. 

'We Want Our Buses Back' invites all to this open meeting to get ideas together for really effective protest. Please spread the word, leaflets will be available nearer the date. Any thoughts on future plans, please get in touch.
