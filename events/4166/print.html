		<td>Yorkshire legends "Vintage by the Kilo" have a &#39;weigh-and-pay&#39; mega-collection of fashion which outsizes any charity shop, and all carefully chosen stuff, not just &#39;jumble&#39;. No disrespect to charity or jumble sales, but this is mainly quality 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s clothing which would have been pricy first time round. 

Every second-hand purchase you make is a nail in the coffin for the fashion industry which makes corporate shareholders obscenely rich by paying exploitation wages, highly polluting from manufacture to transportation, and leading vulnerable people into expensive, illusory lives as fashion-victims. Don&#39;t believe the hype; get yer grunge gear here.
