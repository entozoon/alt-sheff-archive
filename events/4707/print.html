		<td>Fracking is a nightmare, causing toxic and radioactive water contamination, severe air pollution and adding to climate change. Tens of thousands of wells, pipelines and compressor stations are planned to devastate our countryside and blight communities. Join the local group focussing on this, they meet on the first Tuesday of each month. All are welcome. Come and find out more about unconventional fossil fuel extraction, and how people are fighting against it.
