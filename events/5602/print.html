		<td>Back by popular demand, this training is free and open to anyone. It is useful for people that have never been out campaigning before, to those who want to practice their conversation skills. The short training session at Union Street at 11am will cover the fundamental aims and structure of an engaging conversation, then off to put the training to use in the city with the ACORN petition for landlord licensing.

The day will include some standing around outside so bring some warm clothes.
