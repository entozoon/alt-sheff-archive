Set in a stunning river and woodland location at Endcliffe Park, organised by Regather. A very family-friendly festival, the Concerteenies Stage exclusively for 0-3 year olds and their grown-ups gives audiences the unique opportunity to hear live, quality music in a baby-and-toddler-friendly environment, with informal introductions and set alongside sensory activities for little ones, including bubbles, colourful ribbons and little-hands percussion.Sheffield&#39;s Site Gallery returns for their &#39;Introducing&#39; stage and Video Art Tent, presenting a fantastic line-up of contemporary performance, music and video art, commissioned and selected by and for young people in Sheffield. All activity will be curated and produced in collaboration with the Society of Explorers, Site Gallery art collective of 14-19 year olds who are encouraging young people to express their interest.Other attractions include: a forest school run by Middlewood Nature Nursery, with free positive outdoor experiences in the woods; a kids&#39; area packed full of activities and organised games; and an expanded arts & crafts market with some of the best local craftspeople showcasing their work.The popular Heritage Craft Workshops will return, meaning opportunities to work with and learn from some of the finest crafts people in the area, including blacksmiths, woodworkers, and wool spinners.
