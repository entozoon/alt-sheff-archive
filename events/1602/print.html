		<td>SYMAAG meeting with 2 special guests to help understanding of  2 very different migration-related issues. 

First, Mamo, from Sheffield's Syrian Kurdish community will try to answer questions about the current situation in Syria, its background and how it relates to migration from Syria.

Second, Celia Mather will lead a discussion about the rights of migrant domestic workers. Celia was at a recent conference in Geneva of the International Labour Organisation which affirmed that all domestic workers should have the same rights as any other workers. SYMAAG has campaigned over this issue and the decision (despite the UK Government representatives' refusal to support it) is an important one. Come to the meeting to help make this decision a real one for migrant domestic workers in the UK.
