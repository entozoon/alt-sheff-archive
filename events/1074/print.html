		<td>A very special sneak preview of the upcoming documentary Just Do It: get off your arse and change the world. The film follows a year in the life of UK climate activism. The individuals in the film have picked up the mantle of civil disobedience and direct action - chaining themselves to Parliament, super-gluing themselves to bank trading floors, and attacking coal power stations en-masse. It is a call to action in the face of catastrophic climate change, ineffective world leaders and greedy corporations. It urges us not to wait for others to act on our behalf, but to intervene when we see injustice, to take action against all odds and to take the future into our own hands.It is a documentary film pushing boundaries, an experiment in crowd-funding, group production and community engaged filmmaking.

This is a very special work in progress screening of the film, plus a discussion on the legalities of working with people
labelled 'criminals' by the law. Don't miss your chance to see clips hot off the edit and hear director <a href="http://www.emily-james.com/">Emily James </a>speak candidly about the issues thrown up by her unprecedented footage.

Tickets are £6.90/£5.50 concs. Email <a href="mailto:Lauren@just-do-it.org.uk">Lauren@just-do-it.org.uk</a> for tickets
