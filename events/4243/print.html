		<td>Time to tell our leaders we must leave the age of fossil fuels behind! Come with your family and friends and be part of the growing climate movement – all welcome! Activities will be in Tudor Square, outside Crucible Theatre and indoor spaces nearby from 12 noon to 4.30pm, with loads going on including: stalls, refreshments and activities, a mass sing and silent vigil at 2pm, ‘Climate Cake-Off’, Make a Wind Turbine, Face-painting, ‘Evil Frackers’ Photo Booth, cycle rides, bands and choirs and a debate.  – we will post timings of other specific activities soon.

Organised by Sheffield Climate Alliance, as part of the UK-wide series of actions at the beginning of the UN climate talks in Paris (the 21st conference of the parties, or COP 21). Part of the Global People’s Climate March to call for a fair and adequate deal to prevent catastrophic climate change – and to continue building a powerful movement to overcome corporate interests and force governments to act in the interests of the majority and of future generations.
