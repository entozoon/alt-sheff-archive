		<td>The start of a cycle ride focussed on the <a href="https://www.stoparmingisrael.org/">UK arms trade with Israel</a>. There are now no restrictions on arms exports from the UK to Israel. This growing market in making money out of human suffering is seen as "business as usual".

Last year’s Big Ride for Palestine was very successful, it was greeted by a wave of support and raised £65,898 for the Middle Eastern Children’s Alliance. The purpose was also to highlight the consequences of the 51-day 2014 Israeli bombardment of Gaza, which (according to the UN) killed 547 children and traumatized 400,000.

This year the ride will highlight the role of Britain in helping to arm Israel - particularly with drones. Sheffield is one of four cities where groups of cyclists today set out from, raising awareness and solidarity with Palestine. They will converge two days later on Shenstone, Staffordshire, at an arms factory called UAV Engines, owned by Israeli arms company Elbit Systems. Elbit Systems are Israel’s biggest private arms company, and their factory in Shenstone makes parts for drones.
