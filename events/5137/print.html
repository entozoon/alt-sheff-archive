		<td>Friends of Burngreave Library are working with local residents and businesses to organise a friendly and fun event in and around Burngreave. This is a response to some of the recent criminality that has impacted on the local community. They want to celebrate the diversity of the area, support local businesses and encourage local residents and people from outside the area to come together and discover what local shops, cafes and restaurants have to offer. They would also like to produce a guide to eating out at Spital Hill. The event has been organised in a very short time and will include a street party at Pitsmoor Adventure Playground for under 13s in the morning, an afternoon of sports and youth activity in Ellesmere Park for the 13-18s in the afternoon, music, dance, performers and stalls around Ellesmere Green, Ellesmere Park and local streets. 

It’s the middle of the summer holidays and if you can help or support this event it would be very much appreciated. How you can help… Spread the word and come on the day, visit the local shops, enjoy a meal or a coffee at many of the local cafes and eating places. Stalls: There will be space for information stalls – no costs but you will need to supply your own tables and chairs etc.

If you want to join in or would like any further details, please contact: <a href="mailto:lynbrandon@hotmail.com">lynbrandon@hotmail.com</a>, <a href="mailto:gamal@daleeltravel.co.uk">gamal@daleeltravel.co.uk</a> or <a href="mailto:mail@burngreavemessenger.org">mail@burngreavemessenger.org</a>, or tel. 07876 550465</td>
