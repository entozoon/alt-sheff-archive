		<td>Tourism is a significant aspect of many of our lives, with the industry now contributing to 10% of the world’s GDP and creating 1 in 11 jobs globally. But how does tourism impact global development? The sustainable development goals (SDGs) are a new set of global goals set to shape the development agenda until 2030. Tourism is explicitly mentioned in three of the seventeen goals and this emphasis on tourism within the SDGs brings to the fore the possibilities of tourism as an avenue to development, but also brings with it questions and concerns about what type of development tourism might bring and how tourism can promote development and sustainability for all alongside considerations of social justice and equality. Tourism has long been associated with economic growth but how does it contribute to the social and environmental dimensions of sustainability?
 
Starting with a showing of a short documentary film, The Goose with the Golden Eggs: tourism on Costa Rica’s Pacific Coast. The film grew from a 2-year study by the Centre for Responsible Tourism (CREST) assessing the impact of large scale tourism – resorts, holiday homes and cruise tourism in Costa Rica. 

 This will be followed by a talk by keynote speaker Dr. Julia Jeyacheya, ‘Political Reform and Tourism Development in Myanmar’. Julia is an active researcher, currently working on the political economy of tourism development in Vietnam and Myanmar. The main focus of the research is in coastal and island settings. She has previously worked and researched tourism development in southern Africa’s desert regions.

There will also be time for discussion and refreshments.</td>
