		<td>A Positive Money monthly talk, given by Prof John Singleton. The Eurozone has been in crisis for five years. Unemployment is high in much of southern Europe and there are doubts over the ability of governments to pay their debts. These were key issues in the recent Greek elections. The situation in Europe is changing every day. 

This talk will examine how the Eurozone is supposed to work, and whats gone wrong. It will also explore whether European monetary union is consistent with the principles of Positive Money, or whether the Positive Money proposals are designed for an individual country with its own currency. Positive Money is a campaign to create a money and banking system that works for society and not against it. 

John Singleton is Professor of Economic and Business History at Sheffield Hallam University. The author of "Central Banking in the Twentieth Century" (2011), he is currently writing a book on the history of economic disasters from the First World War to the current world financial and economic crisis.

The talk starts at 7.30pm, doors open and refreshments (50p) from 7.15pm. A donation of Â£3 per head is requested, to cover costs.
