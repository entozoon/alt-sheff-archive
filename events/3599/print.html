The channel will be open, diverse and inclusive, locally owned and run for community benefit. It will broadcast news about Sheffield alongside programmes covering Sheffield music, sport, culture and much more, "Made in Sheffield, Made by you". It will collaborate with existing community radio station, Sheffield Live! which has been broadcasting via FM for nearly seven years.
