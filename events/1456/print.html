		<td>To celebrate International Workers' Day Library Workers For A Brighter Future and Sheffield Uncut would like to invite you to the opening of the Sheffield Peoples' Library. The exact location, a tax-dodging high street target is to be announced on the day, but they will meet in Cathedral Square at 1pm and proceed to the venue to occupy till 3pm and transform into a library.

Bring a book, sit down and read. In honour of Mayday, the theme is 'Trade Unions and workers rights', so if you don't already have something to read on that subject, get down to your library and see what they've got in stock. 

The action will create a library, complete with Storytime, reference service and real librarians! Why? Because our libraries and public services, and the livelihoods of those who work in them, are under threat while billions of pounds, enough to clear the deficit and then some, is lost to tax avoidance by multi-national companies or handed out to save banks from their own ineptitude and corruption.
