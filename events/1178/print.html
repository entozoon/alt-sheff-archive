		<td>The <a href="http://socialequality.org.uk/">Socialist Equality Party</a> is convening a <a href="http://wsws.org/articles/2010/nov2010/brit-n15.shtml">series of public meetings</a>, as the basis for instigating a politically independent mass social movement against austerity.

The public spending cuts of £83 billion being imposed by the Conservative/Liberal Democrat government will devastate the lives of millions. At stake are the destruction of social provisions and the onset of mass unemployment, poverty and homelessness on a scale not seen since the 1930s.

The claim that austerity is the price to be paid for returning Britain to “prosperity” is a fraud. The cuts are a direct result of the £1.5 trillion bailout of the UK banks that was carried out in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crash—the equivalent of Britain’s entire annual GDP. In the United States alone, the total cost of the bank bailouts and various stimulus programmes is projected to reach at least $12 trillion, i.e., more than the total cost to every nation of waging the Second World War.

This struggle is international in scope. War, austerity, unemployment, poverty, attacks on democratic rights, and environmental destruction are not British problems. They are world problems requiring global solutions. To defeat these attacks, the working class in Britain must wage its struggles in unison with those of its class brothers and sisters throughout Europe on the basis of a strategy for the unification of working people internationally.

This is the programme of the Socialist Equality Party. All those who wish to discuss these crucial issues are warmly invited to attend.</td>
