		<td>Sheffield city centre event by Sheffield Save Our NHS - stall plus sideshow about Cameron and Clegg butchering the NHS - Come along, join in handing out leaflets, petitioning and talking to the people of Sheffield. 

Come and See &#39;Operation Privatise the NHS&#39;, with Clegg and Cameron pulling the guts out of the NHS and selling off the contents. All welcome to join in the action, if you are really keen you might come dressed in theatre greens, medical coats or as greedy businessmen profiting from the NHS sell-off and bring banners.
