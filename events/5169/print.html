		<td>Google has begun blatantly censoring left-wing sites under the excuse of removing "false news". Well-read sites such as the World Socialist Web Site have been blacklisted so they do not come up in search results. The Socialist Equality Party and International Youth and Students for Social Equality (UK) are holding this public meeting on the subject as part of a series of public meetings in the UK in opposition to Googleâ€™s censorship.</td>
