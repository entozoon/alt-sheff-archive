		<td>Sheffield Kashmir Working Group has called this rally as a reminder of the demand for a just and peaceful solution to the Kashmir conflict. Thousands of killings, rape by paramilitary forces, displacement and years of hostility followed the British division between India and Pakistan, hurriedly drawn as a line on the map.

The rally is timed to precede the Commonwealth Summit in April, in London. To sign the online petition of support, asking  Sheffield City Council Leader Julie Dore to support the British Kashmiri campaign, go to the link below.
