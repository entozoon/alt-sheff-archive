		<td>This autumn, Bill McKibben, the 350.org crew, and a wide range of climate leaders will hit the road to help build a movement strong enough to change the terrifying maths of the climate crisis. The Fossil Free Europe Tour isn’t your typical lecture – it will include speakers from across social movements, powerful videos, and music from the ground-breaking artist Filastine. Stories from student activists, faith campaigners, community energy leaders, joined on video by the likes of author Naomi Klein and former Archbishop Desmond Tutu.

Be part of a unique experience, unlike any talk you’ve been to before. Can’t make it to one of the live shows? No problem. Livestreaming from the London show will be in Sheffield from  7.30 so grab a seat by 7.15  - doors open from 7.00
