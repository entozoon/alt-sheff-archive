		<td>Women in Black will be holding a vigil around two issues relating to sexuality and asylum. The first is 'corrective rape', and its prevalence in many parts of the world, but in particular South Africa where 1 in 4 women have been raped by the age of 16 and 1 in 4 men will openly admit to rape. The second is a call to the British government to recognise the need to grant asylum to some people on the basis of sexual orientation - homosexuality is still illegal in 80 countries around the world.
All women welcome to join in for all or part of this vigil. There will also be leaflets to distribute as well as letters and a petition to sign.
