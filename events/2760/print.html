		<td>Please join in the 7th annual ASSIST World Over Concert. Come and celebrate the wonderful and diverse communities that make up Sheffield with an evening of singing, dancing, music, poetry and even a refugee fashion parade!

Featuring:

-	Umubano Congolese Choir – Lovely harmonies via the Democratic Republic of Congo.

-	Cordão de Ouro Capoeira Sheffield – Appreciate the art and benefits of capoeira, a unique Brazilian art-form that blends martial arts, dance and music.

-	Mulembas d’Africa – Release the energy, expand the soul, embrace the roots… Experience the raw and energetic beauty of Angolan dance.

-	El Addo Fashion Show – El Addo Limited is a worker co-operative developed at the University of Sheffield. Its work is connected to the University’s ‘university of sanctuary’ policy, to educate students on the issues facing refugees and asylum seekers. The project supports refugees and asylum seekers to develop sewing, designing and business management skills.

+ much more!!!

Also be reminded of the reasons for this event, with an opportunity to listen to some compelling stories from people faced with seeking asylum in the UK and hear why the work of ASSIST is important to their safety and wellbeing.

This is a key date in the ASSIST calendar, and one of many Refugee Week/Summer of Sanctuary events across the city. ASSIST are very pleased that the University has, once again, agreed to sponsor the event and host it in the historic Firth Hall. They look forward to seeing you on the night!
