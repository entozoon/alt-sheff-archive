		<td>Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign welcomes everyone to a very interesting and important meeting with Professor Jeff Halper, the Director of campaign group Israeli Committee against House Demolition (ICAHD) <A href="http://www.icahd.org/eng">www.icahd.org/eng</a> 

Jeff is a remarkable man, a longstanding and selfless campaigner for the most basic human rights of the Palestinian people. He is an Israeli Jew who has defied the authorities to help get justice. Certain individuals show real moral and physical courage in their commitment for the oppressed. Jeff Halper is such a man.

Israel has illegally demolished 24,000 Palestinian houses since 1967, part of the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, around Jerusalem and to make way for its apartheid wall. Israel is also engaged in the collective punishment of Gaza Palestinians, 1.5 million people are enclosed in a poverty stricken ghetto. Jeff was on one of the Free Gaza boats that broke the siege of Gaza. He was jailed for this when he returned home to Israel. He is currently out on bail.

Jeff has been awarded Palestinian citizenship and has won various honours including the Kant World Citizen Prize for 2009 and Rachel Corrie Peace Award. His books include, An Israeli in Palestine: Resisting dispossession, redeeming Israel and Obstacles to Peace . 

Please come to the meeting, and tell everyone you think may be interested: friends, union and work colleagues, community members, church, mosque, synagogue and other religious groups. We do not have long to spread the word because many people are away in August.
