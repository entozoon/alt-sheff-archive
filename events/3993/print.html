		<td>Free event organised by local activists and volunteers, which brings together over 50 radical booksellers, distributors, independent presses, and political groups from around the country. It features books, pamphlets, zines, films, speakers, panels and workshops, and is followed by an evening social. Also check out ongoing events leading up to the weekend.

The word ‘anarchism’ tends to conjure up many unfavourable images. The Sheffield anarchist book fair aims to banish these myths by introducing a rich and living tradition of libertarian socialism that advocates freedom through the organisation of a democratic and equal society. The event introduces the intellectual, ethical, creative and fun aspects of anarchist thought as well as the anarchist movement today.

Anarchists argue that there is an alternative to a world of cuts and crisis and a society ruled by profit. This alternative is based on systems of mutual solidarity, controlled from the bottom-up directly and democratically. This is not a utopian dream but builds on the real and historical experiments of people in struggle, from the Diggers of 1649 to the Peasant and Worker Councils of Ukraine in 1917, right up to contemporary self-managed and co-operative industries from Spain to Argentina. Anarchists continue to involve themselves in the struggles of workers, landless peoples and those oppressed by gender, colour, ability or sexuality arguing the benefits of organisation, direct action and solidarity against the power of bosses, politicians and landlords.

If you would like to get involved with the organising of the event you can contact the co-ordinating collective.
