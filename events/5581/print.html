		<td>A show about having sexual fantasies that don’t align with your politics, about trying to understanding what you want, and wondering how the hell to ask for it. Performance artist Louise Orwin asks the difficult questions as she takes you on a surreal joyride through femme sexuality and violence. 

Talking openly and honestly about sex, this one-woman show interrogates identity, consent and power play. Features explicit  Barbie’n’Ken role-play, pop culture references, and sound design by Alicia Jane Turner. For anyone who has ever struggled to find their sexual voice, or questioned the sexual culture they were brought up in, this dares to speak about a subject which is rarely addressed publicly, especially in the wake of #MeToo.

Age Guidance 16+. Trigger Warning: Show contains description of sexual violence. Tickets £9.07–£11.19.
