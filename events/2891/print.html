		<td>Celebrate the end of the main growing season, with FREE admission to the farm. Food, craft, gift and bric-a-brac stalls to browse. Enter your veg and homemade produce into the Produce Show. Do you have the tastiest tomatoes or the biggest onion? Enter the show and you could win Garden Centre prizes. For a produce show entry form drop by the main office or email <a href="mailto:s.hardy@heeleyfarm.org.uk">s.hardy@heeleyfarm.org.uk</a>.

For children: face painting, Vegetable Theatre from Madame Zucchini, vegetable entertainer, make a veg monster, craft activities from Creation Station in the stable yard classroom, and animal petting in the small animal house. Hold guinea pigs from the cuddly corner or lizards from the scary area! Sheep Race at the end of the day (who will be the one back to the stables first?)

Felt-making and metalworking demonstrations. Learn about the heritage projects in the Roundhouse Woodland. Activities in The Energy Centre. Homemade cakes and seasonal food in the Farm Kitchen. Produce Auction at the end of the day to raise money for the farm.
