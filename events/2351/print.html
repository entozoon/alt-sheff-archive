		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Our oceans are dying. Overfishing is one of the major issues facing the world today and illegal fishing activities are damaging eco-systems and pushing species to the brink of extinction. Emerging from some of the more established conservation organisations, a group of people founded a new organisation in 2010 named The Black Fish. Within a couple of years this initiative has grown into an international marine activism movement, with numerous victories already under its belt. 

Join co-founder of The Black Fish, Wietse van der Werf for an evening of information and inspiration. Learn about the growing problems created by industrial overfishing and the creative ways in which The Black Fish is turning the tide. 

Doors open at 6.15pm, presentation starts at 7pm, free entry
