		<td>Universal Basic Income (UBI) is gaining interest. It is a system where everyone receives a regular sum of money, without means testing, and whether or not they have a job, or work voluntarily. How would it change your life? UBI Lab Sheffield explores perspectives on it through three video interviews, plus vox pop audio capturing the views of people in the city.

Note there is also a late opening on Wednesday 26th: 10am-8pm. Free to attend, part of the 2018 Festival of the Mind.
