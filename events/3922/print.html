		<td>Independently-owned media is a vital platform for people to share and discuss ideas, voice concerns and connect with their community in a deeper and more meaningful way. Join this roundtable discussion about the importance of independent media to the city, with representatives from Now Then, Silence Breaker Media, Sheffield Live, and more to be confirmed.

The Festival of Debate is taking place in Sheffield in the run-up to the General election, during March and April. It provides opportunities to get together and discuss a range of issues which affect everyone. Informed decision making and strategic planning are essential for democracy, so come and get involved. They also welcome volunteers, from attending events and taking part in discussions to volunteering time to help run an event, promote the festival and much more. Unless otherwise stated events are free to attend, but if possible please register via the appropriate Eventbrite link on the Festival of Debate website below to give organsisers an idea of numbers.
