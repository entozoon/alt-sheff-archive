		<td>Jellybean Jazz are a 5 piece band who play jazz inspired music that you will know and love, and want to get up and dance to! Think Nina Simone, Cole Porter, Miles Davis... classic songs with the jellybean twist for added heart and soul. They are all sensational musicians, so don&#39;t miss the chance to hear them play in one of Sheffield&#39;s great traditional pubs.

Entrance is free but donations are all to ASSIST.
