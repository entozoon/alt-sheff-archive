		<td>A discussion about sharing a home with children, parents or grandparents. This age-old way of living became much less common under 20th century western capitalism. Now it is back in the news, with increasing housing costs, declining wages, cuts to care provision for older people, jobs vanishing and huge university fees. A panel of housing specialists share their research on the possibilities and issues in returning to multigenerational living. 

Led by Angela Maye-Banbury, Principal Lecturer in Housing Studies at Sheffield Hallam University. Part of Understanding Society, the festival of social sciences, organised by the universities (Sheffield and Hallam), funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.
