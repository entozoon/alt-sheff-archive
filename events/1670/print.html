		<td>The film "Debtocracy" is presented by speaker Lidy Nacpil, a debt activist from the Philippines. 

The film looks at the real causes of the current debt crises, and real alternatives which governments refuse to even consider, preferring to force the ordinary people to pay via benefit cuts and the loss of jobs in the public sector. The bankers and politicians whose negligence, greed and criminality caused the crises, are liable to benefit from these cuts.
