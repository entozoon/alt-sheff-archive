		<td>Sheffield Cuba Solidarity Campaign presents special guest speakers Carolina Amador Pérez and Ana Milagros Martínez Rielo of the Federation of Cuban Women (FMC).

A unique opportunity to hear first hand about the achievements made by women in Cuba over the last 50 years, the challenges they still face, and the latest news from the island. Six months after the Haiti earthquake almost 1000 Cuban trained medics are still volunteering in the country. The meeting will also provide an update on Cuba’s support in the country and show a short film about the role Cuban doctors in the aftermath of the earthquake. The FMC is one of the largest women's organisations in the world with more than 3 million members aged 14 and above. Its work has contributed to the fact that women now make up 42% of elected parliamentary positions in Cuba.
