		<td>Green Homes Sheffield aims to give householders ideas and confidence on making their homes more energy efficient. A range of homes across the city will show features like insulation, draught-proofing, solar panels, heat pumps, energy-efficient windows and extensions, and different levels of carbon saving. People who have made a good start on the path to a low carbon home are opening their homes to the public to enable others to learn from the energy-saving improvements made and inspire them to make changes themselves. 

The initiative is part of national network <a href="http://www.greenopenhomes.net/">www.greenopenhomes.net</a>. This is one of 4 events during April and May. 

For more details see <a href="http://www.greenhomessheffield.net/"/>www.greenhomessheffield.net</a> or email <a href="mailto:jenny.patient@regather.net">jenny.patient@regather.net</a> or call or text 07760 174335.</td>
