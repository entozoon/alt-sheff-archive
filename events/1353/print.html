		<td>The Re-open the Woodhead Line Campaign are pleased to announce a very special event 'An Illustrated History of the Woodhead Line' with John Quick, a member of the Great Central Railway Society. The first in a range of activities commemorating the 30th anniversary of the decommissioning of the Woodhead Line. A good opportunity for anyone interested in finding out more about the rich industrial history of the area and the tangled story of the Woodhead Line, from inception through to heyday and eventual closure. 

Although this event is a retrospective, the campaign very much hopes it won't be the end of the story for the line! Accompanied by an in-depth slide show John will travel through the history of one of the most iconic railway routes in the country, from establishment and the construction of the famous tunnels, through to decline. The last train ran along the Woodhead line on 17th July 1981. 

No entry charge, but any donations on the night will be welcome. 

Founded in 2009, the Re-open the Woodhead Line group campaigns for the re-opening of the Woodhead train line between Manchester and Sheffield. More info: <a href="http://savethewoodheadtunnel.blogspot.com/">Re-open the Woodhead Line website</a>

A series of events are planned to mark the 30th anniversary of this event. More details at <a href="http://savethewoodheadtunnel.blogspot.com/2011/02/30-years-and-counting-re-open-woodhead.html">http://savethewoodheadtunnel.blogspot.com/2011/02/30-years-and-counting-re-open-woodhead.html</a></td>
