		<th>Details</th>
		<td>A Transition Sheffield Cafe event offering a chance to explore environmental sustainability in Sheffield, along with Jack Scott, Cabinet Member for Environment, Waste and Streetscene.

There are possibilities of changes to recycling services, street-lighting and cycle lanes. Can the recent recycling improvements be delivered in the light of current budget cuts? How sustainable will the highways maintenance PFI be? (i.e. Do opportunities for cutting the energy footprint of street lighting and improving bicycling routes outweigh the possible financial unsustainability of private finance initiatives?)

Got an idea for how policy could translate into sustainability on the ground? Come to the Cafe, listen to some of the council plans, and discuss how transition ideas could take shape in Sheffield.

Transition Sheffield is part of the growing Transition Town movement, tackling climate change and peak oil with practical hands-on solutions that work.
