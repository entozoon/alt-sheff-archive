		<td>Sheffield Palestinian Solidarity Campaign presents a new film, the culmination of 7 years work. In 2005 a group of Palestinian children and young dancers visited Sheffield from Al Aseria Children&#39;s Centre, Jabalia refugee camp, Gaza. This is a film of their visit, their current dreams, and the impact on their lives of the Israeli attack in Operation Cast Lead in 2008.

It is a moving and powerful film.

The food will be fantastic as usual.

Tickets £10 waged/£7 concessions. Money raised will go to the children&#39;s centres in Gaza.
