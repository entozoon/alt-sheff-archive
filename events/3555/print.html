		<td>The annual family and cultural festival and celebration of the Labour Movement in South Yorkshire held in Wortley Hall, co-operatively owned and run, in the hands of the Trade Union and Labour Movement for decades. 

Fun for all ages, with dozens of stalls, crafts, gifts, falconry displays, dancers, face painting, coconut shy, bouncy castles, rides and games, music and entertainers, bars, food and drink in the beautiful setting of Wortley Hall and 27 acres of quiet woodland, formal and landscaped garden. 

Admission is usually free, although the car park charges. Bus number 29 runs every hour or two from Sheffield Interchange, get off at Wortley, then go down the drive to the hall.
