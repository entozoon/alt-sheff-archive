		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The supporters of Sharrrow Festival are preparing for 7th July this year, when thousands will come, bringing together a diverse community and celebrating unity. 

They invite local people, people who have experience of festivals and people who have never been involved before. A free, fun pre-festival afternoon of drop-in activities and cake! You can help to make some festival decorations, eat scrummy cake and hear some of the music that will be performing on the day. There is even a Sharrow quiz. 

To give something back to the festival you can add your name to the list of volunteers (they need 30 people) and talk through what job you might enjoy most.
