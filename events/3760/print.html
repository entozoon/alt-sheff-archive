		<td>Are you gay, lesbian, bisexual and/or transgender? Working less than eight hours a week? Want to learn how to make a film? For free? Then E.D.E.N Action! is for you. After the huge success of E.D.E.N Incubator, which saw members of Sheffield?s LGBT community produce <a href="http://edenfilmproductions.us3.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=7da4fd651b45d0aa84eb25593&amp;id=f4d47f183c&amp;e=d894dd17d2">Families Like Ours</a>, a film that hit the big screen earlier this autumn, E.D.E.N Film Productions launches E.D.E.N Action! Project. This is a free film course for unemployed members of the LGBT community in Sheffield starting 17th December 2014 and running weekly until April 2015. The project is aimed at empowering unemployed LGBT people with the skills to tell stories through film whilst educating members of the public about LGBT diversity.

The course will set out individual goals for each participant and is taught by industry professionals, giving skills for life whilst helping create a society in which everyone is accepted for who they are. Covers more than how to film and edit video footage, participants can bring their own ideas. The sessions are run in a safe, welcoming and accessible environment.

Please note that only those who meet the course criteria will be accepted on the course:
* Participants must be over 16 years old
* Participants must identify as LGBTQ+ or non-straight
* Participants must work less than eight hours per week
* Participants must be able to commit time and effort to the project, attending weekly sessions and sometimes extra filming or editing dates
* Participants must be able to travel to the course location in Sheffield city centre as well as possible other filming locations.

E.D.E.N Action! starts on the 17th of December and the second session is on the 18th of December before a short Christmas break. Sign up, or find out more, by emailing <a href="mailto:info@edenfilmproductions.co.uk">info@edenfilmproductions.co.uk</a></td>
