		<td>This 4 session course is ideal for those who want to begin to understand today’s world and make the changes, says tutor Graham Birkin. 

"Globalisation? What’s New?" Check the shelves in the supermarket, the migrant labour in the Lincolnshire fields, the labels on your T-shirts and find out that what you eat, what you wear and how you feel are all part of globalisation. 

The course is FREE. This is session 2, so confirm by emailing <a href="mailto:graham@birkin194.fsnet.co.uk">graham@birkin194.fsnet.co.uk</a> or tel. Sheff 2423609.</td>
