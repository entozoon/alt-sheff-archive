		<td>Ever felt you had to vote with your head instead of your heart, because of the archaic voting system we have for General Elections? 

The Referendum to be held on 5th May could change all of that. For Valentineâ€™s weekend, the Sheffield "Yes!" To Fairer Votes will be outside the Town Hall with banners and a stall, telling people it is time to dump the system that cheats us and to embrace a better option.
