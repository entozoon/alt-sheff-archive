		<th>Details</th>
		<td>The Anti Trafficking and Labour Exploitation Unit (ATLEU) is a small charity that specialises in legal advice to victims of modern slavery. They are opening an office here, and marking the launch by bringing people together who work in this area.
 
The event will be almost three years after the Modern Slavery Act came into force and will look at what life is like for survivors now. Paul Blomfield MP will be speaking, as MP of Sheffield Central and someone who has a strong interest in the rights of survivors of modern slavery. He helped establish the charity Focus on Labour Exploitation and is now their trustee. He is also a member of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Migration. 

Also a panel of speakers including Detective Sergeant Nikki Leach from South Yorkshire Police Anti-Slavery Unit, Phillipa Roberts, Director of Legal Policy at Hope for Justice, barrister Lucy Mair of Garden Court North and Robin Brierley, Chair of the West Midlands, Cleveland and Cheshire Anti-Slavery Networks.

There will be several members of the ATLEU team present to speak to after the event. Hosted by Irwin Mitchell Solicitors, who are also providing refreshments (drinks from 6.30pm). There is disabled access. Free to attend but it would be very helpful if you email <a href="mailto:carita@atleu.org.uk">carita@atleu.org.uk</a> to give them an idea of numbers and if you have any dietary requirements.</td>
