		<td>Films to celebrate LGBT History Month. In Addicted To Fresno, recovering addict Shannon leaves rehab to join her sister at work in a hotel in blue collar California. Things quickly spiral out of control when a racy encounter goes spectacularly awry. With clashes between unrequited lesbian crushes and co-dependent sisters, Fresno is absurd, dark and wildly funny.

Chick Habit includes queer icon Jamie Babbitt with a pop sensibility of technicolour and polyester, drawing inspiration from John Waters, Edward Scissorhands and Barbie! Her breakout film But I’m A Cheerleader (1999) is one of film’s most seminal lesbian comedies. 

Jump on the party in the bar with "But I’m A Cheerleader"-style indie pop-punk disco – Chick Habit! Featuring Chicks With Decks (currently stumbling around Sheffield on their ’Shit Disco Tour’) and DJs from INVERT
