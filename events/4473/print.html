		<td>Alt-Sheff urges everyone to please support the bid to launch a new film festival, started by people from (and friends of) the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community in Sheffield, co-ordinated by <a href="http://edenfilmproductions.co.uk/">E.D.E.N. Films</a> (a social enterprise which does film-making and campaigns for diversity/LGBT+ equality and rights). 

If it works out, it will be called <strong>"(Trans)forming Cinema"</strong>. Funding of £39,976 has been requested from "The People’s Project" and the decision will be based on supporters’ votes. <strong>They need hundreds of votes before midday on Sunday 13th March. PLEASE CIRCULATE THIS MESSAGE ON SOCIAL MEDIA </strong>. 

The festival would be the first ever Transgender Film Festival in South Yorkshire, and could be really significant in raising awareness of transgender people and the issues they face, tackling ignorance and reducing discrimination. It would feature short films on topics including younger transgender children, hate crime and media representation.

Sheffield diversity activist Trevor says: "Over the last three years I’ve had the pleasure of participating in three of E.D.E.N. Film Productions projects, where I have received training in film-making and been supported to make films with a lovely group of people. Our films have been shown at the Odeon, Arundel Gate, a Sharrow Festival fundraiser, Diversity Fest and at both universities and lots of pubs and other places around Sheffield."
