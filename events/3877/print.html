It also allows light onto the woodland floor, creating an environment for other flora and fauna to thrive. Learn how to fell small trees by hand and how to process them ready for use as firewood, craft material and brash. This course will use traditional woodland tools such as a bowsaw, axe, felling lever and rope to fell the trees and a billhook, pruning saw and loppers to process the wood. Learn to identify which trees are safe and suitable to cut down for various needs. Learn how to use hand tools safely and effectively. Learn where the safe zones are, and different types of cuts to use on a tree when felling depending on size and state of the tree.

Learn the different woods and what their uses are.
