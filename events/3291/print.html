		<td>A free showing of the multiple award winning film "Roadmap to Apartheid" as part of Israeli Apartheid Week 2014. Narrated by Alice Walker (author of The Color Purple) it covers the rise and fall of apartheid in South Africa, and why many Palestinians feel they are living in an apartheid system today, and why an increasing number of people around the world agree with them. The film documents the life of Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and inside Israel, and includes contributions by respected analysts on the subject.
