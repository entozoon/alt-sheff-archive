Sheffield libraries have an amazing story to tell. And you are a central character! Come along to The Big Book event at Sheffield Central Library on 23 March and be part of the action... Tell the government and the council why they have lost the plot, why you want libraries to stay open and run by paid, professional staff. Tell us why libraries mean so much to YOU...

Libraries? A waste of money? Not in OUR book...

Local libraries provide a vital service for communities, one that can only be properly delivered by a publicly funded and controlled library with paid, professional library staff. People across Sheffield are working to keep all our libraries open and ensure that nobody in our city is deprived of the essential services that publicly and professionally run libraries can provide. Yet... Sheffield council wants to pass on millions of pounds worth of government funding cuts to the people of Sheffield. The council admits that this will have a serious negative impact on the public services we all rely on. In order to make these savings they claim that at least 14 of the city’s 27 community libraries will either have to close, be taken over by private companies or run by voluntary organisations.

Let’s make sure the story of Sheffield’s Libraries has a happy ending.

A peaceful family-friendly protest against cuts to library services in Sheffield. Meet outside our central library.</td>
