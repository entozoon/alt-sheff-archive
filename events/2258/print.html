		<td>Sheffield CND invite you to join them for a Peace Picnic to commemorate UN International Day of Peace, outside the RAF base at Waddington, Lincoln. The new reaper squadron of unmanned armed drones operaing in Afghanistan will be controlled from here.

Drones make war more likely as the pilots controlling them are thousands of miles away so there are fewer British deaths, so war is "cheap". Being so far away from the point of killing can create a play station mentality in the operators. Drones hit civilians, and can go out of control altogether - 95 drone crashes since 2007. Drones are surrounded by secrecy and a lack of accountability.

Sheffield CND have booked a coach to go to Waddington on 23rd September to demonstrate opposition to these frightening weapons. It will leave Pond Hill (near Sheffield interchange) at 10-30am and leave Waddington at 4pm. The cost will be Â£14. If you want to join in please email <a href="mailto:crippskath@gmail.com">crippskath@gmail.com</a>.
Bring food, and if you play an instrument or sing it would be good to have your participation.
