		<td>LaDIYfest presents a screening for LGBT History Month. Shirin is struggling to become an ideal Persian daughter, politically correct bisexual and hip young Brooklynite but fails miserably in her attempt at all identities. Being without a clich√© to hold onto can be a lonely experience. The screening will start at 6.30 sharp, free admission.
