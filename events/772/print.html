Too bad if you weren't invited to the invitation-only preview evening on Thursday to question representatives from Sainsburys and Fletchers. The public gets 11 hours to see the preliminary plans by Sainsburys and Fletchers to submit a planning application for the development of land at Fletchers bakery site off Claywheels Lane.

Wadsley bridge can look forward to a new 50,000 sq ft Sainsburys megastore and restaurant (and recycling area aww, bless 'em). 400 full and part-time jobs, 425 car parking spaces and so much congestion for this busy area that a new road junction is needed to Claywheels Lane from Penistone Road.
