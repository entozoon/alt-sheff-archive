		<td>Breeze is the biggest programme ever to get more women into riding bikes, aiming to help thousands more women feel confident and comfortable about going on a ride. While cycling is becoming more and more popular in the UK, the proportion of women getting involved is actually declining. Breeze wants to change that. Fun, social, local bike rides for women at a speed that suits everyone include these rides in parks in Sheffield and Rotherham.

The Rotherham event is at Herringthorpe Stadium, which has car parking, toilet and refreshment facilities.
