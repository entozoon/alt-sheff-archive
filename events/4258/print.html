		<td>Sheffield Trade Union Council (TUC) is stepping up the fight to stop the Tories new anti-union legislation which will severely restrict the right to strike – and push unions outside of the law. It is also designed to cripple the Labour Party by making it much harder for unions keep a political fund and use those funds to support the Labour Party. There is no doubt that this poses a real threat to our civil liberties in a democratic society.

Sheffield TUC is holding this public rally with speeches in opposition to the Government’s anti-trade union bill. The TUC is holding its “Kill the Bill” Lobby of Parliament on this day and many local Trades Councils are expected to do the same.
