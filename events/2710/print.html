		<th>Details</th>
		<td>In this series of three public lectures, made possible by a Leverhulme Trust Award to Sheffield Hallam University&#39;s Department of Humanities, visiting professor Laura Tabili presents insights drawn from her in-depth research into the history of overseas migration to Britain. Her work has important implications for current debates on overseas migration and community cohesion.

Lecture 2: Closed communities? Integrating migrants in provincial England. Current debates on community cohesion often present a picture of homogeneous white working-class communities reacting negatively to the challenges of cultural diversity posed by post-war migration. However the historical picture was more complex, and some migrants enjoyed a high degree of integration with the ’native’ population.

Laura Tabili is Professor of Modern European History at the University of Arizona and Leverhulme Visiting Professor at Sheffield Hallam University. She is a leading historian of ‘race’, racism, migration and empire in Britain between the mid-19th and 20th centuries and author of two path-breaking books in the field: <i>We Ask for British Justice: Workers and Racial Difference in Late Imperial Britain</i> and <i>Global Migrants, Local Culture: Natives and Newcomers in Provincial England, 1841-1939</i>.

Places are free and include refreshments, but must be booked in advance.
