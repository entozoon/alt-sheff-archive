		<td>Food foraging is gaining in popularity - join us on a guided walk around the Farm in the company of food foraging guru Patrick Harding indentifying what plants can be safely eaten. Discover the different culinary uses for plants which we normally wouldn't consider using as 'food'; dandelions, chick weed and nettles for example can be delicious, and free, additions to our meals. Patrick will identify such plants on the Farm and on its surrounding green spaces. Finishing time is approximate.

Meeting outside The Farm Kitchen
Tickets are £7 from the main office - fundraising event to help raise money for our projects.

Phone the Farm office for more details or to book tickets - 0114 2580482</td>
