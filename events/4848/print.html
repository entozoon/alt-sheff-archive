		<td>A friendly and welcoming art workshop for asylum seekers and refugees. Some of the artwork produced may be used to create greetings cards which will be sold to raise money for ASSIST to support destitute asylum seekers in Sheffield by providing accommodation, food and support to those in most need or distress. ASSIST is a charity totally reliant on volunteers, grants and the generosity of the people of Sheffield and the surrounding area. Why not come along and give it a try?
