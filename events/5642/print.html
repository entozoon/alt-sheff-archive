		<td>Hamid Baygi has lived in the UK for 50 years. Now the Home Office want to deport him to Iran on Tuesday 4th June. This is what the UK "hostile environment" looks like. 

Hamid volunteers to support refugees in Sheffield, now he needs our support. He has studied at Chippenham and Brunel Technical Colleges and worked in a liaison capacity to British universities and as a teacher in Worcesteshire. In 2001, he was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK. 

Please read his details and sign the petition to stop the deportation of Hamid, at this <a href="https://www.change.org/p/home-office-hamid-baigi-lived-in-uk-about-50-years-will-deport-to-iran-4th-june-stop-deporting-hamid">Change.org page</a> and if you can, support this demonstration.
