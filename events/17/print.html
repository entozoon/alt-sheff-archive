		<td>The Justice for the North West 10 (J4NW10) Campaign was set up because 9 Pakistani students in the north of England are currently detained and facing deportation as a 'threat to national security'. Their appeal against deportation is at the end of this month, and the students and their lawyers will NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE EVIDENCE - they may be deported never knowing the evidence against them. 

Solicitor Gareth Peirce representing one of the students described his client as innocent, and the use of secret evidence as a "weapon in the armoury of the State" which the UK is "seeking to export"

Speakers in this campaign against vilification of the Pakistani community and criminalisation of young Muslim students include:-

   Tariq Mehmood: Campaign Spokesperson 

   Mike McColgan: Liberty - speaking on legal aspects
