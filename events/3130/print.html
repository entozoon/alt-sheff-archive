		<td>Fancy pitting your wits against the finest minds in Sheffield? The famous Fat Cat Pub Quiz have kindly invited Sheffield Amnesty International Group to play a small part in their weekly question-a-thon on Monday the 2nd of December. 

As well as The Fat Cat&#39;s provision of great food, ale, and top quizzing, Sheffield Amnesty International will be bringing a 50/50 raffle draw and some greetings card actions to the table in observing Human Rights Day the following week. There may even be a question or two on human rights, giving them a slight advantage...

Food and drink deals begin from 8pm, pub quiz starts at 10pm. See you there!

Amnesty International meets on the 2nd Wed of every month (except August) 7.15pm at the Quaker Meeting House, St. James St.
