		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. This time it's 'Bounded Infinity' - a bike ride more or less within the inner ring road to experience the mathematical phenomenon of an 'infinitely' long (non-repetitive) path within a finite boundary.
