		<td>Hazelhurst Community Supported Agriculture Co-operative aims to help reconnect Sheffield communities with where their food comes from, by getting people involved in growing organic food on a beautiful two-acre site in the Moss Valley, just south of Sheffield. Having recently appointed a grower who will start on 1st March, they have a polytunnel and a composting toilet up and ready to go, and launch their share offer at this exciting event, <i>From your Farm to your Fork. </i> Rebecca Laughton, presenting, is an expert on community-based organic, sustainable cultivation, and author of <i>Surviving and Thriving on the Land</i>

The evening also includes a presentation of the Hazelhurst Oral History project – finding out about life and farming in the Moss Valley.

And the formal launch of the share offer, giving you a chance to invest anything from £50 to £5000. Find out how you can become part of this exciting co-operative venture by investing your time as a volunteer.

Welcome with home-made food 6.30pm, 7pm start.
