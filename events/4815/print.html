		<td>BBC Masterchef Quarterfinalist Chris Hale launches a weekly pop-up cafe every Monday at the Union Street pop-up cafe, which now opens Monday to Friday with a variety of themes.

Although from Wakefield, Chris has become a familiar face in the Sheffield food scene. The locals have welcomed him with open arms and adventurous palates, and he praises the support he has received from the council and the community of independent food traders. The first event he held at Union Street was a complete sell-out.
