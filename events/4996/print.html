		<td>William Horsley, International Director for the Centre for Freedom of the Media (CFOM) at the University of Sheffield, provokes the question: Is balance out of date? The open Internet age spells information overload and the demise of old media. The tenets of journalism - balance and objectivity - risk being swept away too. Will new ways be found to hold power to account? Or are we heading back towards information fortresses?
