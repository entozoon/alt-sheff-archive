		<td>Is the pressure on the NHS due to increasing demand and expectations? Or reductions in funding, staff and other resources for health and social care? Or inherent inefficiency? Or lack of effective prevention? Or the wear and tear of constant reorganisation and increasing privatisation? Are the new NHS plans a sign of progress, or simply cuts in disguise? 

Join an expert panel to debate how we can secure the NHS for future generations.
