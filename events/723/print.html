		<td>Public Meeting/Sheffield Launch of a campaign with Martin Empson (national Campaign Against Climate Change Trade Union Group) and Phil Turner (local Right to Work campaign). 

All the major parties wanted us to pay for the bankers' bailout, and now the new government promises huge cuts in jobs and services. But we need a massive investment in climate jobs to avert the threat of catastrophic climate change â€“ and at the same time targeted spending can lift us out of the present recession.
