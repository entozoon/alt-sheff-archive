		<td>Strike from school to demand action on the climate catastrophe. Students, pupils and young people, globally are waking up to a reality where we can no longer choose to ignore this issue. This is a Global Emergency. 100,000 species go extinct annually due to pollution. Resources are running out, and we only have 10 years left to save the planet. We must stand up and fight for our future or face an uninhabitable planet. 

All welcome.
