		<td>Diagnostic thinking has a powerful and pervasive impact on mental health services, structuring guidelines (such as NICE), research, administrative systems and care pathways. This talk will examine what is included and not included in the diagnosis driven ‘evidence base’, which has become prescriptive for practice, not only in mental health, but also more widely across social care and education.

Focusing on childhood psychiatric diagnoses such as ADHD and autism the evidence base that supports (or otherwise) the scientific validity and clinical utility of using a diagnostic framework will be critically evaluated. Ideas on how culture and practice may develop in a direction that is more effective, compatible with the scientific evidence, and encourages a wider more diverse view of children, childhood and families will be explored.

Sami Timimi is a Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist and Director of Medical Education in the National Health Service in Lincolnshire and a Visiting Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of Lincoln. He writes from a critical psychiatry perspective on topics relating to mental health and has published books, articles and chapters on many subjects. He founded the International Critical Psychiatry Network, is co-founder of the group ‘Culture and Equality in Mental Health and is patron to the ‘Carefree Kids’ charity and has led on many innovations including the Outcome Orientated Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (OO-CAMHS) project  and the Outcome Orientated Approaches to Mental Health Services (OO-AMHS) project.

Skeptics in the Pub get-togethers are relaxed and enjoyable evenings while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. The events are free though they ask for a £3 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along.
