		<td>NO2ID, campaigning on the threat to liberty and privacy posed by the rapid growth of the database state, of which "ID cards" are the most visible part. Don't be fooled by the recent government announcement, compulsory passports are no different from ID cards and should still be opposed.

The Sheffield group meets monthly. Everybody is welcome. The meeting room is upstairs, congregate in the bar before the meeting or ask the bar staff for directions.
