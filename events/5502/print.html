		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Red Haus is a radical Café with books, offering beer and vegan Korean food. They are thinking about transforming into a co-operative, and need people-power for this. It would focus on books about politics, history, pop culture, sociology and related fiction, and maybe even a co-operative lending library and space for events. Interested? Drop in and talk to them about it, or email them. They need ideas and people for the transformation.
