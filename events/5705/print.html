Incredible things are happening in Sudan. In early June, the Transitional Military Council, which took power after the downfall of Bashir after 30 years of brutal oppression, itself turned brutally on the Sudanese rebels who had maintained a sit-in outside their military headquarters in Khartoum. 

The Sudanese revolution had united those across ethnicities who had been oppressed by the Bashir regime. Prominent amongst them had been new unions formed in most industries and services and brought together in the Sudanese Professional Association (SPA).

The struggle of civil resistance continues. In response to the military massacres, there was a 3 day general strike and road blocks have been set up by the rebels to impede the now heavily armed murderous RSF militias. The Sudanese revolution needs our solidarity. 

This meeting will include discussion what we in Sheffield can do to help. A collection will be taken to support the Sudanese revolutionary movement.</td>
