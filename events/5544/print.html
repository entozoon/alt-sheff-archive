		<td>The Cult of K*nzo is a theatre show that takes an insider’s look at consumer culture through the lens of fashion. It interweaves the stories of one woman’s lifelong desire for luxury and the young dream of becoming a fashion designer. In a world where ’you are who you wear’ The Cult of K*nzo looks at how high end designer brands create desire, the tension between inclusion and exclusion, and the mysterious allure of high end. Why do we want the things that we want? What’s in a brand?
