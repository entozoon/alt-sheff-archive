		<td>Sheffield Equality Group meets on the second Thursday of the month and aims to campaign in a way that interests and excites people. 

It is looking for a local issue to campaign around, something quite specific on income inequality or the impact of it. It could be an issue for a member of your family or friend, a neighbour or work colleague, or even you. If there's something practical you think the group can campaign on locally, even if in just one street on one estate, then come to the next meeting to talk about it. It's a way of using joint skills and what we know to really make a difference, and raise the profile of the group. The campaign might involve existing groups such as TARAs or forums and/or provide a space to campaign outside of them. Donations for room hire, all welcome.
