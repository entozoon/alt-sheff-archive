Thu 4 Feb 2016, 6.30pm,  Aizlewoods Mill, Nursery St. S3 8GG,

2016 AGM of the Sheffield Co-op Party, which recently took part in a successful ‘Keep it Co-op’ campaign, to secure the ongoing support of the Co-operative Group for the party’s work. In Sheffield they ran official Labour and Co-operative candidates for the first time in May’s city council elections. In the autumn they held a Co-operative Action Network training session with Stella Creasy MP, and a discussion session on co-operative finance.  

The first part of the meeting (6.30-7.15pm) will be the formal business of the branch AGM. The second part (7.30-8.30pm) is open to non-members who are interested in the party. It is a discussion session, with several local co-operatives attending to talk about their work and how all can support the movement in the year ahead.  

Limited parking is available on site. After-meeting social at the Harlequin pub, next door.
