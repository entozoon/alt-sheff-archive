		<td>Sharrow Lantern Carnival 2018 is on Sunday 1st April and there are free lantern making workshops running on Saturdays and Sundays 1-5pm until the day before the carnival.

The workshops rely on volunteers; you do not need to know how to make a lantern, they will teach you. You just need to be friendly and happy and help new people when they arrive to make a lantern. They are looking for 2-3 lead volunteers for each workshop and then as many other willing hands as possible. 

If you are interested please email <a href="mailto:creativeactionnetwork@googlemail.com">creativeactionnetwork@googlemail.com</a> and try to attend on Saturday 27th January, 10-12pm for a training session.
