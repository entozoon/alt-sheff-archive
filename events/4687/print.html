		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Discussion of whether anarchist organisations can have constitutions and still be consistently anarchist, or indeed whether they need to have constitutions to be consistently anarchist. In addition, looking at examples of constitutions to try and identify what anarchist principles are enshrined in them and how the rules included in the constitutions can be seen to safeguard those principles.

The workshop will run for maximum 2 hours with a break in the middle. All welcome. A follow-up workshop to the Anarchy Rules! discussion that took place at the Sheffield Anarchist Bookfair in April. Newcomers who did not attend the April workshop are also welcome. A third workshop to try and do some co-production around anarchist rule-making and constitutionalism will be discussed.

If you are able to attend this workshop, no need to register, but please let them know so that they can book refreshments, (or if you cannot make it but want to attend similar discussions in the near future) by email to <a href="mailto:anarchyrules@riseup.net">anarchyrules@riseup.net</a>. A small amount of money is available to support travel costs. Forms will be available at the workshop from Loughborough University staff.</td>
