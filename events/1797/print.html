		<td>Sheffield CND (Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament) holds it&#39;s annual general meeting with speaker Janet Fenton of Scottish CND. 

She will talk about implications for the Trident missile programme of Scottish independence. CND Vice-Chair Jeremy Corbyn MP recently discovered that the Lib-Dem-led review of alternatives to Trident will never be published. It seems that the government is afraid to discuss this matter, and is trying to suppress the debate. There is a new invigorated campaign on this issue being launched by national CND. 

Come and join in, newcomers are welcome.
