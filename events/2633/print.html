		<td>Evening fun bike ride for everyone, on the theme of railways (which were invented in the north of England). Starting at the location of the first railway station in Sheffield, this is a ride to Meadowhell and beyond, visiting railway stations past and present.

Sheffield railways are still in use, the passenger network is thriving and steel and coal are still transported through the city by rail as well as limestone from the Peak District, and waste.

18 mile ride, fairly flat route, refreshment stops on the way. Riders will be collecting donations for the Railway Children charity - or donate online at <a href="http://www.railwaychildren.org.uk/">www.railwaychildren.org.uk</a>
