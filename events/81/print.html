		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride offers a monthly evening bike ride.  Their motto? “We have nothing to lose but our chains”! (But bring locks and lights, just in case).

This ride is on the theme of Ginnels, snickets and tracklements, a ride in the city to take in some of the surprising number of shortcuts, and alleys that are all over Sheffield. Starts in the town centre and heads out to Broomhall and the University and then plunges into Sharrow, Heeley and Meersbrook before climbing up through Nether Edge to Greystones touching Fulwood and then back into Sharrow to end up at the Pomona. This ride will also pass, and probably stop, at the Sheaf View and the Rising Sun(!) About 15 miles total but not only can you drop out when you like, you can join when you like: the ride is being led by Simon, who says, far from losing people en route expects to pick up a few. There are joining opportunities at Broomhill, Heeley (Sheaf View), Greystones, Fulwood (Rising Sun) and of course after the ride at the Pomona. 

Bring lights (some riding through parks) and locks! Should suit most types of bike.

Just give Simon a call on 07799 834837 and he will let you know where they are or Mick on 07949 596702.
