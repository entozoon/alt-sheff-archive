		<th>Details</th>
		<td>Sheffield Friday Night Ride (FNR) offers a fun monthly evening bike ride for everyone. Rides are prepared in advance on themes. This time the theme is breweries since 1900. 

This ride is close to the city centre and takes in sites of old and new breweries. Breweries were close to water (as was some of the beer?) so the ride is by the River Porter, Sheaf and then up and down along the Don, ending up in Neepsend at The Sheffield Brewery. NOTE there will be an opt-in tour of the brewery (1-1.5 hours). The tour will cost £5 pp and that includes two pints of beer. The food will cost £5 pp with meat or vegetarion options. So the choices are: 1. Ride only at no cost, 2. Ride plus tour (incl. 2 pints) at a cost of £5, 3. Ride plus tour plus food at a cost of £10. You decide! If your choice is [1] then just turn up. For beer/food, book via the website. 

Advice: Cycling a bike, drinking two pints of beer and eating a meat and potato pie with peas may be dangerous. Participants are recommended to do one thing at a time
