		<td>40 years ago a military coup plunged Chile into a brutal right-wing dictatorship, the first country in the world to experience the shock of "neoliberalism". Many fled the country, some arriving here to make Sheffield their new home. 

Now, in commemoration of the anniversary, there is a series of events including this exhibition "Arpilleras, Photographic and Political Caricatures". Launched Monday 4th at 7pm, the exhibition will be on display until 8th November.
