		<td>All women welcome to join this vigil, which this month is publicising how women are disproportionately affected by climate change. There is a letter for people to send to their MPs asking that they raise this issue with the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (Chris Huhne) requesting that all climate change negotiations, policies and institutions are gender-sensitive and involve women and women's organisations at local, national and international levels to promote effective community-wide resilience to climate change.
