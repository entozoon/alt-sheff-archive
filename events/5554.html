	<p class="message">In the wake of the EU referendum it is clear that we have a democratic deficit in the UK - that a range of different voices with a host of genuine concerns are not being heard or enabled to speak to power effectively.

Suggested donation for daytime events £51.30-2.15pm <strong>Workshop: What Does 21st Century Workplace Democracy Look Like?</strong> Sheffield TUC explore workplace democracy, the role of unions and legislation in aiding workers. How much of a voice can workers exercise in contemporary employment, which is often characterised by low pay and insecure work?1.30-2.15pm <strong>Workshop: Disability and Democracy in Healthcare.</strong> The government says it wants to create a society where disabled people can realise their aspirations and potential.
