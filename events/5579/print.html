		<td>A play that explores the theme of barriers, borders, obstacles, and margins; how people overcome or cross them, whether physical, geographical or personal. The themes are very current and relevant to our times, touching on hunger, famine, bravery, travel/migration/moving to ´greener pastures´ and based on direct experiences the group members have had. The performance uses only live music, sound and singing.

Entry is free/donation - pay what you feel, book at the link below.
