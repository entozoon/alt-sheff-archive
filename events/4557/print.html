		<td>After the success of TEDxPitsmoor 2015, new talks. new ideas and visions. More delicious cake. some entertainment. Free entry. This year a completely new batch of local speakers with powerful things that they want to say about life, art and sometimes Pitsmoor. The speakers have been working hard on their talks. They have a professional technical set-up.

They have a licence from TEDx to hold this event, with no budget or money. They keep to the TEDx rules: no promoting of businesses, inflammatory religious or political views, or pseudo-science. No talks about rayguns!
