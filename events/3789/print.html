		<td>This new documentary is being screened as we pass through the 30th anniversary of the historic 1984-85 Miners&#39; Strike. South Yorkshire was heavily affected and the strike was widely supported. It was prompted by a deliberately savage mass closure of coal mines by the Thatcher government, deeply damaging communities dependent on them. The official reason was low profitability, but it was later proved to have been a pre-planned neoliberal attack on nationalised industry, and the power of the highly organised and left-wing National Union of Mineworkers. This moving documentary, by Bad Bonobo films, includes previously unreleased material from the time. It was the Audience Award Winner at Sheffield Docfest.

For tickets call Mick Fitz on 01709 761047 or pay on door. Wath is accessible by public transport from Rotherham, and Montgomery Hall is in the town centre. There are other showings at various venues, for example see 16th and 30th January.
