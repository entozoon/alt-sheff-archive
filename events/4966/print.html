Part of Festival of Debate. Sheffield is an active and engaged city. In the past it has been instrumental in national politics, with activism by workers, students and communities. The Festival of Debate has become part of this ongoing history, as it enters its third year with a season for spring 2017. Events include panel discussions, debates, Q&As, artistic responses and keynote speeches, at various venues. It is hosted by not-for-profit social enterprise <a href="http://www.opusindependents.com/">Opus Independents</a> (which also publishes a monthly Alt-Sheff column in <a href="http://nowthenmagazine.com/sheffield/">Now Then magazine</a>).
