		<td>A group reading "PostCapitalism" by Paul Mason. This month discussing chapter 5. The book is currently only available in hardback but you can get it second hand. If you want to buy from an excellent workers co-op, it is available by mail order from <a href="http://www.newsfromnowhere.org.uk/books/DisplayBookInfo.php?ISBN=9781846147388">News From Nowhere</a>

Note the pub meeting room is upstairs, sorry no disabled access. The group welcomes new members, just turn up, ideally if you can read up to chapter 5, of course.</td>
