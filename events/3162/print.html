		<td>Positive Money, activists for monetary reform, have been going for two years in Sheffield, so this is an appropriate time to look at the progress made - locally, nationally and internationally. This talk by Peter Verity, coordinator of the Sheffield group, will give an insight into what actions are being taken centrally, and in other groups around the country. Local groups are an important part of the Positive Money strategy, playing a crucial role to get the debate going among the public, media, and academics. Peter will explore new initiatives needed to meet challenges. There will also be discussion on how to to communicate ideas of monetary reform.
            
Voluntary donation (suggested £3) requested to cover the cost of the room, and £1 for tea/coffee/biscuits.
