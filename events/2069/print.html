		<td>The next meeting of Sheffield Humanist Society will be asking whether the current international and domestic policy on drugs has failed. Is it unethical? Should drugs be legalised? Alex Martin, University of Sheffield Atheist Society will explore the history of drug prohibition and explain why he thinks Humanists should support the legalisation of drugs.
