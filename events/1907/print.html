		<td>Skeptics in the Pub is about getting people together to have a relaxed and enjoyable evening while listening to talks on a wide range of topics, usually by a notable scientist or skeptic. This time: Fringe Historical Linguistics - Non-Standard Theories Of The History Of Languages. 

There are many non-standard ideas about the origins, relationships and histories of languages, especially ancient languages. These ideas are rejected by those professional linguists, but often attract support among fringe historians and the general public. This talk will provide a brief critical overview of these non-standard claims and theories. 

Mark Newbrook, a professional linguist associated with the world-wide skeptical movement, has spent many years as a linguistics lecturer and researcher in Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia. A free event but a Â£2 donation is requested,
