		<p class="info">Mon 25/Tue 26 Aug 2014</p>
		<p class="message">‚ÄúOnly an ignorant fool would think that competition is a good thing in health and social care‚Äù says Dr John Carlisle, Sheffield‚Äôs first altruistic organ donor, who gave a kidney to a stranger. <br /><br />On Monday 25th, Sheffield will welcome the national People‚Äôs March for the NHS, a mass protest against cuts and changes putting the NHS under threat. Its 300 mile route follows in the footsteps of the historic Jarrow Crusade. The marchers will arrive having walked this stage via Barnsley Hospital. They will go through Worsborough Mill, Tankersley, Grenoside and Hillsborough around 3.00pm approximately, where Sheffield supporters will join the march at Hillsborough Park. (Assemble at the Parkside Road entrance, by the carpark). Then on to Weston Park for a rally with speeches at 4.30pm. On Tuesday 26th the march will set off from Sheffield Town Hall at 10.00am towards Chesterfield via the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, then going through Nether Edge, Woodseats and Dronfield.<br /><br />Organised by the Darlington Mums‚Äô group, 999 Call for the NHS. Sheffield Save Our NHS is co-ordinating the event locally. Mike Simpkin of Sheffield Save Our NHS, says ‚ÄúWe hope up to 1,000 people will join us ... the NHS is in danger from cuts and being broken up through tendering it out to individual firms. It could be gone before we know it." Come and show support in opposition to the threat of charges, and the disaster of privatisation and competition in health care.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.sheffieldsaveournhs.co.uk/">Sheffield Save Our NHS</a>.<br /><a href="http://www.sheffieldsaveournhs.co.uk/darlington_mums_march_20.html">Detailed further information about the Sheffield stage of the march</a>.</p>

		<p class="message">Sheffield Fayre returns for its twelfth year, with the Council signalling an end to the high degree of military recruitment involved. The focus is on the fantastic traditions of the fairground, in response to public demand and appreciation of the National Fairground Archive (based at University of Sheffield). This theme has been developing over the last few years thanks to the dedication of Professor Vanessa Toulmin. <br /><br />There will be a "Merrie England Village", street performers, dance and performance including morris dancing and maypoles, horticultural and craft tent, loads of stalls, food and drinks, and plenty of charity and community involvement.<br /><br />Free entry. Organised by Sheffield City Council in partnership with the Friends of Norfolk Heritage Park and The University of Sheffield Fairground Archive. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.welcometosheffield.co.uk/dms-connect/search?dms=13&amp;feature=1001&amp;venue=2163766&amp;easi=true&amp;c1=front&amp;nojs=1&amp;townid=1241&amp;c2=sheff%25ield&amp;ssurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thedms.co.uk%2fstylesheets%2fstandard%2f&amp;srchtyp=N">Welcome to Sheffield website</a></p>

		<p class="message">Climate change has been described as one of the biggest threats facing the world, but international action to mitigate the impacts of human activities on the climate is moving slowly (if at all). Why is there continued reluctance to act, and why do some people refuse to believe that climate change is even happening despite the high degree of confidence expressed by scientists?<br /><br />Chris Hassall will outline briefly the science behind climate change and the tangled web of special interests that have sought to muddy the waters over a range of important scientific topics from tobacco smoke to the ozone layer. He will also discuss his role as a skeptical activist in investigating the extent of climate change denial at a Canadian University, and discuss the importance of skeptical involvement in education.<br /><br />The talk will conclude with a discussion of the similarities across various different types of science denial, and some recent research that skeptics can use to guide their efforts to promote science in hostile communities.<br /><br />Chris is a lecturer in Animal Biology at the University of Leeds, with particular expertise in the biological impacts of environmental change and large-scale patterns in ecology and evolution, predator-prey interactions, and freshwater science. <br /><br />A Skeptics in the Pub get-together. The events are free though they ask for a ¬£3 donation, and the meetings are open to all whatever your beliefs and views so please come along. At Farm Road Sports and Social Club press the buzzer to be let in, meeting in the back room of the Club.<br /><br /><a href="http://sheffield.skepticsinthepub.org/">http://sheffield.skepticsinthepub.org</a></p>
