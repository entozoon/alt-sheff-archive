The boy struggles to fit into the bush life he‚Äôs been forced into until one day an unexpected visitor appears ...<br /><br />Written and created and performed by John Rwoth-Omack Far Gone is a gut kicking physical performance with humour, poetry, and the horrors of being a child soldier. The play also explores how the political and financial decisions made by western powers affect the life of a child soldier and it may even contribute to it. It takes into account the campaign ran by Invisible Children of Kony 2012 to expose and capture Joseph Kony, and asks how ethical this was really, and what the American government really did to help.<br /><br />Part of Festival of Debate 2019.
