		<p class="message">Purple and green copies of the free Hannah Directory will be appearing in leaflet racks when the 4th edition launches on the week of 6th June 2016. Hannah Directory celebrates 50 people and organisations â€˜doing great stuffâ€˜ across the north of England. This year the Sheffield selection includes both <strong>Alt-Sheff</strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.webarchitects.coop/">Webarchitects</a></strong>, the eco-friendly Sheffield co-operative which supports Alt-Sheff with website hosting.<br /><br />Distributed by hand through its network of participants and supporters, Hannah Directory is a not-for-profit initiative. Contributors are chosen on merit and there is no fee for inclusion. It is named after and inspired by Hannah Mitchell (1872â€“1956), a suffragette and rebel. The green and purple colour scheme of this yearâ€˜s directory was chosen to reflect the original suffragette campaign colours. <br /><br /><a href="www.hannahfestival.html">Hannah Festival</a></p>

		<h4><a href="events/4629.html">Practical solidarity in the UK asylum and immigration system</a></h4>
		<p class="info">Tue 14 Jun 2016, 6-8.30pm, central Sheffield</p>
		<p class="message">Do you want to know more about how the UK asylum and immigration system works (or doesnâ€™t work!)? Do you know newly-arrived asylum-seekers in the UK and want to know what you can do to support them? Do you want to meet others who are interested in this or are already doing this? Look no further â€“ these workshops are for you, whether you are going through the process yourself or helping others.<br /><br />Most people now know about the perilous journeys refugees make in an attempt to reach a place of safety and security.  Of how many that lose their lives en route, or are stranded at borders across Europe, or are encamped in squalid conditions and under constant attack in Calais and Dunkirk. A dark corner of this story is that, for the refugees and other migrants who make it to their destination â€“ the UK â€“ the struggle isnâ€™t over.  People seeking the right to remain in the UK are faced by a bewildering, complicated and hostile asylum and immigration system and with diminishing legal help to navigate it. The policies and procedures of the UKâ€™s asylum and immigration system are increasingly complicated, with many people forced to navigate them alone, unable to access free legal advice and representation.  These procedures can exclude people from accessing justice, and can mean that people are denied their rights, denied protection in the UK, and face forcible return to the situations of war, persecution and insecurity that they have fled. But there are important actions that the person going through the legal process, their friends, supporters and communities can and should take to overcome these barriers to justice and safety. <br /><br />This is Workshop 2 in this series. The workshops are free, and will be in English. Please note the Right to Remain workshops are intended for individual supporters and activists who wish to learn more and get involved with solidarity actions for those going through the asylum and immigration system.  If you are from a local service provider, or have contact with asylum seekers in a professional or volunteering capacity, please contact <a href="http://www.assistsheffield.org.uk/">ASSIST</a> about their â€˜Asylum Basicsâ€™ training sessions. <br /><br />Light food and refreshments will be provided. Venue details will be given to those who have registered to attend.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.righttoremain.org.uk/blog/find-out-more-about-the-asylum-and-immigration-system/?subscribe=success#blog_subscription-2">Right to Remain</a></p>
